下面正文开始
  New York, New York. The  city  so nice they  named it twice.
   These  words were used to describe  New York when it was  by far the largest,richest, and most  developed city in the United States. New York still remains the largest    and most famous city in the U.S. today, but some of its"nice" reputation has fallen over the past thirty years with  stories of  rampant  crime making headlines around  the world. How true are these stories? Is New York still a "nice" place to visit? if so, what can a tourist do in New York? Let's  take a closer look  at America's    premier city .

   First, as personal and social security are always  uppermost  in the minds of travelers, just how "dangerous" a city  in New  York? Despite the glaring headlines, New York, Located in the northeastern U.S. ,is  one of the safest cities in the U.S. In fact, New York state(which includes New York city -- thus, "New York, New York, the city so nice they  named it twice") ranks  below other big-population  states like  California  in both violent crime(of much concern to the tourists)  and property  crime. Other  major cities have  higher crime rates, too. Thus, the foreign traveler to New York city  can feel more secure here thant  in most other large metropolitan areas of the U.S. .

  11:58  Besides safety, why do more foreigners visit New York than any other American city ?The  answer  lies in the character of New York itself. No  other city  in the world is more cosmopolitan. A  walk through  its hundreds of residential neighborhoods is  like  walking  around  the world itself. Place  names like  Chinatown and Little Italy  can be found  on any map of New York, but smaller ethnic neighborhoods also  abound. Also, all these  groups sponsor annual or  seasonal festivals, so that  nearly every week one or more of these peoples will share  their cultural experiences (and food!) with other New   Yorkers.

   17:45 Besides the internationally famous  sight-seeing attractions -- mostly in the borough (district) of Manhattan -- such  as the Statue of Liberty  , the World Trade Center with  its two 110-story towers, Wall Street, the United Nations, and Broadway, many other  interesting places await the curious traveler.   The  Bronx Zoo in  the northern borough of the Bronx is one of  the world's best.  The  borough  of Queens  offers a great variety of etnic  residential neighborhoods.  Brooklyn  contains  the Botanical Bardens. Coney  Island (a  beach with  an amusement park), and J.F.K. International Airport.

** Lesson two The amish 
 
   In the land of  rock and roll, the space shuttle, computerized living, who could imagine  that  about 50,000 Americans do not use  telephones, electric lights, or cars,o not  because  they  are poor, but out of choice? As hard as this may be to imagine, the American, or more properly, the Amish Mennonites, still  live a traditional, rural [ˈrʊrəl]  乡村的 lifestype direct from  17th century  Europe?                                                                                                            
   To understand these unique Americans better,it is  necessary to understand  their history. Beginning with the   revolution  started  by Martin Luther , Leader of the Protestant Reformation in  Germany   in the  16th century,

**  Lesson 3   indoor pollution
 on another file  jan 2023 

   So you  think  that  by staying at home  you are safe from all the terrible kinds   of pollution present  outdoors,  such as  in  or near factories, reoads, and garbage dumps? DO you  think that by staying in your office you are breathing cleaner, safer air than when  you go outside fou lunch  or are on  the way back home from  work?Think again . Recent research done at the University of Texas has shown  that staying indoors  may actually be  more harmful to  one's  health than   being  outdoors  even in  smoggy cityes.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
   Apparently ,we are  safe neither at home  nor in the business office.We use  water  in both  place, but the above-mentioned research   shows  that  chemicals added to  our local water supply to kill harmful bacteria can have unwanted side effects.These  chemicals can cause potenital harm through  dranking  and in seemingly  harmless   activities as cleaning  one's  house.  These  additives are released from water by daily  actions like  water running out  fo faucets , spraying from garden  hoses, or splashing in dishwashers  and washing machines.As the water is agitated, these  chemicals are released into   the air  and then  breathed in . Once  inside our  bodies,they start to affect our health adversely.   Does  this  mean   we should stop  bathing? No, say the scientists, but we should  put all pollution  into  perspective [pərˈspektɪv]  观点 洞察. Activities at home  such  as the  burning  of propane, coal, cooking  oil, or even  candles and incense release  carbon monoxide  and particulates  such  as soot  which  have been proven as  harmful to healthe as working or living  near high-density traffic.

**  Lesson 5  The animals  around the world: Chameleons
  Every few months this  program will feature an  animal which  has caught the eye of the world's public to become a  favorite or "hot"  animal. In  the first  of this  unusual series, we  will  look at the chameleon, one of  nature's strangest creatures.
  Perhaps no  other  group  of animals  has  caught mankind's  imagination like reptiles.  Among the several subclasses(or "orders" in biology) of  reptiles are snakes and lizards, turtles and tortoises ,crocodiles  and alligators, and the  tuatara, a marine lizard in  New Zealand. The dinosaurs, too, belonged to  the calss o f reptiles. Was it a  snake,lizard, or crocodile that caught the fancy of some Chinese in times gone by  to  create dragon? A perrennial  theme ,reptiles have  been featured over the past ten years in box-office hits and bombs alike as dinosaurs( JURASSIC Park and The lost world), corcodiles, and snakes(Anaconda). Though not nearly as large as these mighty reptiles,, the lowly chameleon nonetheless has amazed  countless generations   with  its special talents and skills.
  What is a  chameleon? Its  unusual name fits  this unusual animal perfectly, for  pit translates from  the ancient Greek as "lion on the ground." This is unexpected, since chameleons spend most  of their time in trees, and as  for looking  like a lion, a chameleon  looks like a .. well, a chameleon! No  other animal in Nature's  zoo looks quite as  bizarre as  they do. Where do they live? True  chameleons  are found  only in the tropical  forests  and jungles of the Old world, and  nearly half of its   species live on the African  island  of Madagascar.
  What's so special about  the chameleon? Plenty! From  its  tongue to its  tail the chameleon  offers a  storehouse  of specialites. The tongue  of this modern-day  dinosaur look-alike  can be  extended more than twice the  length  of its  body. This  type of tongue . also present in frogs and toads, is called an extensile tongue. The eyes of hte chameleon  are even  more remakable. Its eyes are turreted and can be moved independently  so that it can view two  different object simultaneously! This comes in especially handy as it is tree-dwelling. The chameleon can  keep  one eye on its prey  and the  other on its footing. Its head  is often  helmet-shaped, and some  species have horn-like structures  growing  out of  this  scaly helmet.

  The above   inventory of  natural selection specializations would  be remarkable enough, but what  really  separates the  chameleon from its fellow reptiles is  the  fact  that  its  scales contain  the ability to change color. Though many people think  the chameleon  can change its color  at will  and that it can blend into any color, these are misconceptions. In fact,chameleons can  blend  into many  natural colors and even  patterns, but they cannot  do this at will. Instead, this  happens naturally according to  temperature, emotional state of the animal, and the triggering of certain  hormones within its body.

We should  always  remember,however, that these animals require their native habitat to flourish in, not zoos or individuals'  terrariums.

**  Lesson 6 Table Manners in Anglo-America  June 28 2022 
  "Oh ,no Here I am at an American family's home at the dinner table.There are all kinks of plates, saucers,cups,and silverware at my place. Which  should I use  for which food? Should I sit down  first or wait  for the host to invite me? Should I have brought a gift? Someone please tell me what to do!"

manner    美: [ˈmænər]     n.礼貌；举止；习惯；方法

  Have you ever been in or had a nightmare about  this  situation? Don't worry! This article will help  steer you through the rocks and reefs of Anglo-American table manners so  that if you are ever abroad in Canada or the United States, or  at someone's home from  one of  those countries,you will  feel right at home.

ever  [ˈevər] adv.曾经；从来；总是；到底  网络永远；究竟；在任何时候    

  It is  important to distinguish   what kind of  occasion you will be attending before you plan for a pleasant  evening. Most  Anglo-Americas enjoy  entertaining  at home, but they don't  enjoy stuffy, formal dinners. They invite their friendss over  for a fun evening , not as a  test of one's knowledge of cultural  traditions. If, however, you are  invited to a formal affair, such as a so-calld "sit-down" dinner,you may  want to know  in advance some basic rules of "black tie" etiquette.

distinguish  [dɪˈstɪŋɡwɪʃ] v.区分;辨别;分清;成为  
occasion    [əˈkeɪʒ(ə)n] n.时机；理由；原因；某次 v.使发生；造成；导致  场合

affair      [əˈfer] n.事件；事情；风流韵事；公共事务    网络绯闻；私通；恋爱事件
etiquette  [ˈetɪkət] n.礼仪;(社会或行业中的)礼节;规矩

  The first thing  to remember when  attending a dinner at a Western home is  that you  are the guest and that you are a foreigner. No one will invite you if he does  not really want you  enter his "castle," so you can be sure that you are wanted. Additionally, as you do not come from the same country or culture as you host , he or she or they will surely  be aware  of this, and will  be very forgiving if you unintentionally do or  say  something  which  would  otherwise offend them. Keeping these  two simple tips  in mind  should greatly ease your concern about  being present at a dinner in someone  else's  home.

wanted     美: [ˈwɑntəd]  adj.受通缉的  v.“want”的过去式和过去分词

offend     美: [əˈfend]  v.冒犯；得罪；犯罪；令人不适
concern      美: [kənˈsɜrn]   n.关心；忧虑；公司；企业 v.涉及；影响；牵涉；与…有关
present      美: [ˈprezənt]   n.目前；现在；礼物；礼品

  Before arriving at your  host's home. you may want to make sure of three things. First, be a few minutes late,say,about  five to ten  minutes if possible. Never be early, as the host may not have everythng prepared yet. Nor should you  be more than  20 minutes late.Your host may begin to worry about  whether  you are able to attend  the dinner or not. Next , as to whether  to bring a gift, in most informal gatherings,  it is not necessary. If you like, you can bring some fruit or sweets, or , especially  if there is a hostess, some flowers. These are thoughtful, cheerful gifts sure to  please. Do not  bring alcoholic  beverages  unless you are  sure  of your host's  or hostess's preferences in drinks. Above  all , do not spend a lot of money, and never give money. As we say in English ,"it's the thought that counts."
Finally, wear  comfortable clothing. One  can overdress as well as appear sloppy.  For a special occasion  or religious holiday, such as a retirement  party or  Christmas, a tie and jacket would be suitalbe  for the gentlemen and dress  or sweater and skirt for the ladies.

gathering      美: [ˈɡæð(ə)rɪŋ] n.收集；采集；聚会；聚集 v.“gather”的现在分词

cheerful  [ˈtʃɪrfl]adj.令人愉快的;快乐的;兴高采烈的;高兴的

beverage     美: [ˈbev(ə)rɪdʒ]      n.饮料；餐费；〈英方〉筵宴     网络饮品；饮料类；饮料篇
appear  [əˈpɪr]  v.出现；显现；呈现；出版 linkv.似乎；显得；看来
count [kaʊnt] v.计数;(按顺序)数数;计算(或清点)总

sloppy [ˈslɑːpi]  adj. 草率的；粗心的；泥泞的；肥大的；稀薄的
religious     美: [rəˈlɪdʒəs]   n.修女 adj.宗教信仰的；宗教的；笃信宗教的；虔诚的
retirement     美: [rɪˈtaɪrmənt]  n.退休；退休生活；退职；退休年龄

  For  more formal affairs, you will  probably be told what to wear, such as "formal dress requested," etc. A tie  and jacket or tuxedo for the gents and an evening gown for the ladies would  be in order here. If you are  unsure what  to wear, you can  always ask the  host. Gifts are seldom appropriate for these affairs, unless for a wedding reception, at which  gifts are more customary than cash.

affairs [əˈferz]n.公共事务;政治事务;事件; 社交活动
gents  [dʒɛnts]n.男士;绅士;先生;
reception  [rɪˈsepʃn]n.接待;招待会;接待处;欢迎;接待
gown  [ɡaʊn] n.长袍;(尤指特别场合穿的)女裙;女长服;女礼服


  Your  host in  his home will usually motion  you where to sit. At formal gatherings, name cards are sometimes  provided, or  you will  be told  where to sit.Do not be alarmed by a great deal of cutlery simply start from the outside and work your way in.  Formal affairs often have several courses  of food with the appropriate cutlery for each dish. There is no harm in  checking with your neighbor to see what implement he is using. After all, "When in Rome, do as  the Romans do." It is  customary to ask others to pass dishes to you  for self-serving; at a formal dinner party, there is  usually catering(service). Again, do not hesitate to  ask others  for information or advice. They are usually  pleased to help you.

motion  [ˈmoʊʃn]    示意 招呼
provided  [prəˈvaɪdəd]    conj.如果；假如；在…条件下  adj.预备好的；由…供给的 v.“provide”的过去分词和过去式

appropriate   [əˈproʊpriˌeɪt]   v.拨款；剽窃；挪用；〈正式〉非法占有 adj.恰当的
course    [kɔː(r)s]  n.过程；球场；【教】课程；航线 v.流动；(某种感觉)突然
implement  [ˈɪmpləmənt]  v.实施；执行；贯彻；使生效 n.工具 器 具

advice  [ədˈvaɪs]  n.建议；意见；忠告；劝告
again   [əˈɡen]  adv.再一次；又一次；再说；复原

 The most important  piece of advice is this: enjoy  yourself. No host enjoys seeing nervous or fearful guests who are struggling to "do the right thing" at his home  or expensive  formal dinner party. Watch  other or ask for  their advice, and join in the conversation  and  good times as  best as you can . if you  do , after the first  such evening out,you will certainly look forward to the next!

**  Lesson 7 The  Delights of  South Island
  One  of the odder coincidences  of physical  geography  is the  fact that  there are two  double islands, roughly the same   size, positioned at each other's antipodes , or farthest-distant point. The  islands of English  and Ireland in the Northern   hemisphere  and the islands of North Island  and South Island in the Southern Hemisphere  are just such a coincidence. The first two islands comprise the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (or Eire) ,and the second two islands comprise New Zealand. Among these  four islands, there can be no  doubt that South Island  is the least polluted and most spectacularly scenic of them all.

  There is much competition to  make such  a claim. The  island of  English , politically  constituting English, Scotland,and  Wales  of the United Kingdom , is dotted with country  villages set alongside rivers and lakes.  There are not very  tall but nonetheless rugged mountains in the north, and endless miles of rocky coastline  that  seem mystical. Ireland , too, is a paradise of greenery, with far fewer  people than  populous    English and even  more quaint villages scattered  among its low-lying hills and forever green fields. North Island in New Zealand sports a  balmy climate and the beaches to make use of it;  One beach alone is more that 150 kilometers long, and with  relatively few people on its shores, on cant  pretend  one is  at the very end of the earth. Volcanoes,large lakes, and quickly flowing rivers traverse  the land. Given the beauty of these three islands, what makes South  Island so special ?

populous  美 [ˈpɑpjələs]  adj.人口众多的；人口密集的

nonetheless     美: [ˌnʌnðəˈles] adv.尽管如此

  Plenty. For  those who like mountains, South Island is  sure to please.Mt. Cook at 3.764 meters is its highest peak, with  16 others above 3,000 meters. Naturally, many local and foreign mountain climbers come here for  the  challenge of  these Southern Alps. In addition, there is an  extensive glacier system, endless forests,and innumerable lakes throughout this highland area. Some  of the world's best mountain  scenery is available within the 500-kilometer long chain of  the Southern Alps.

scenery      美: [ˈsin(ə)ri]       n.风景；景色；风光；舞台布景      网络景物；景观；景致

  Perhaps you prefer the  sea? South  Island is not only an  island, but many  tiny islets can be found  off its coastline.Great deep-sea fishing, scuba diving, and snorkeling can be had, though the waters here are cooler than those of North Island, (Remember, in the Southern Hemisphere, as we go north, it gets warmer.) As  fewer people  live on South Island than on North Island, those who crave  solitude and pristine beaches will be  amazed at their  luck here. With almost no heavy industry on SOuth Island,the  air, water, and land are all free of  pollution. The local seafood is therefore clean, plentiful, and never-ending.

  Of course, South Island is not for everyone. For those who  need busy, crowded,noisy, and polluted cities.this Southern outpost will surely disappoint. For those who enjoy pressure  and stress, South Island will leave them empty-handed. And for those who would rather stay at home or in an  office in  front of a computer screen or in the thumping,smoke-filled dance floors of discos, some of the world's best natural scenery will never  entice them away. For the rest of us, though,South Island is the world's best-kept secret.If Nature's paradise sounds alluring, make a point of visiting South Island.


  Do healthful climates interest you ? South Island is the place to be. Its temperate  climate sees little snow except in the highlands and mountains areas. Like Ireland and English, there are no extremes of temperature, either. Summers are warm, not hot, and winters are brisk ranther than  freezing. The fresh air is sometimes humid from the abundant rainfall  of this area.Every season invite the nature lover to get out  and be active in the countryside.

** Lesson 8 Ireland's Contribution  to English
   Nearly  everyone knows  that countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America,Canada, Australia, and New Zealand  are primary English-speaking countries;  that is  English  is the mother tongue used in these countries. What  is less well known  is that English is also  the mother tongue in countries such as the Republic of Ireland (officially called Eire), Barbados,Jamaica,Trinidad, and Guyana. Among these latter few, the Irish have made contributions to the English  language in both  its lexicon and literature  which  can be considered second to none.

consider      美: [kənˈsɪdər]  v.认为；觉得；以为；顾及

  Virtually every  aspect of  English  literature has been graced by the  writings  of  the Irish. This  face  is all the more amazing because Ireland is a relatively  small country,with  never more than  four million people throughout its long history. Yea  many great "English" writers were indeed  born and often  raised in Ireland, though many, too, emigrated to the united Kingdom  at some point in their lives.Among these pillars of  English literature were Jonathan Swift,William Butler Yeats,James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Oscar WIde,George Bernard Shaw,and  Edmund Burke. Many other lesser-known figures have punctuated English literature as well. These men's contributions to the English  language and to Western thought in general are immeasurable. A review of two of these writers' major works will reveal why.

**  Lesson 9 Why  Is Basketball  So Popular?   Tuesday  July twnety-sixth 2022
    Soccer and baseball  have  more fans, but no other sport has increased in popularity so quickly  over the pass 30 years than  has basketball. What accounts for the sudden meteoric rise in a sport which, after all, is  played best by people who are  unusually tall ? The secret to  basketball's  success lies is three particular sources: the celebrities  in  game; commercial sponsorship of  those players and the game itself; and  the mushrooming of crowded, urban environments around the world.

  All sports have their heroes. Current, baseball has Mark McGuire and  Sammy Sosa, the home  runhitting kings, Tennis has Martina Hingus and  Pete Sampras,the darlings of the courts, Soccer has players so popular that  they are mobbed by fans wherever they appear, especially in Europe and South America. ONly basketball, however,has celebrities who have caught the attention of the world like no others. Michael JORDAN is popular even  after having officially retired from  the game that there is talk of  his running for public  office in the United States. Dennis Rodman,the muscular,tattooed, and much ballyhooed player formerly of  the Chicago Bulls, make headlines whenever he pulls  another of his crazy but fun-loving publicity stunts. Former players like Larry Byrd and Magic Johnson continue to command respect for their personal integrity and unparalleled sportsmanship. Basketball shoes, T-shirts, and  even movies are make with  these basketball superstar icons. No other sport figures can compete with their popular recognition and appeal.

  Is this international superstar status solely due to  these men's  talents and contributions? In no small part,of course,it is , but  other leading athletes with equally commendable skills or who have performed  attention-grabbing antics rarely  reach the stratospheric level of stardom that basketball players  enjoy. This special privilege is due  to a concerted effort by the players behind  the basketball players, that is, the basketball leagues' owners and sponsors.

  Basketball has  always  been a distant third in sports rankings in the United Status behind baseball and American  football. Basketball league owners and managers wanted to change this traditional perception of the immutability of these statistics and in the 1960s began a concerted effort to make basketball the game  of choice by hand-picking more colorful as well as professional players and  by making alliances with  the commercial sponsors of athletic equipment. By the 1970s, basketball team recognition in the U.S. had soared, with dedicated fans in the millions. Teams like the Los Angeles Lakers, the Chicago Bulls, and the Boston Celtics had become household names. Players like  Magic Johnson  and Michael Jordan were  worth milions of dollars in commercial advertising  spots for  athletic equipment  manufacturers, a trend which  continues to this  day. Today , basketball is  a billion-dollar business.

   No amount of advertising,  however, can account for  the number of fans who  not only double as spectators  but as  players themselves. Basketball
   courts, whether in schools,parks, or abandoned  city lots, have sprouted throughout the urban landscape.  A child is never far from a basketball ball and hoop.  With land becoming more expensive in ever more crowded cities, city governments  are fat more likely  to construct basketball courts than  baseball diamonds or soccer fields. As basketball equipment is minimal and inexpensive , it is no wonder that the game  has become more and more popular around the world.

   spectator     美: [ˈspekˌteɪtər]  n.旁观者；(看比赛等的)

   What young boy doesn't dream of becoming as tall  as a  basketball player, or at least of having  as much money or fame? Basketball's quick pace and dynamic plays are in contrast to the much slower moves in baseball or even   in much of soccer and American football. This dynamism is part of the pulse of our times, and so long as  we live in  a fast-chang-ing  world,basketball  and  its players will continue to appeal to sports lovers around the wold.

** Lesson   eleven   English in the Caribbean    Aug 16 2023 

      When  we hear the  word  English, we  naturally  think  of the language  spoken by  those  living in the  United Kingdom  or of the people living  in England. We also  often think  of their language as the international language, the one spoken as a  native language in Ireland, the United States, Canada,Australia, and New Zealand,countries which  have had a close association 有关 with  England for centuries. However, English is  spoken as a native or second language in a  large number of other  countries which  were once colonies(殖民地) of the  British Empire.
      
   Latin America,  including Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America, is often thought of as  a linguistically语言上  homegenous 同类  area of Latinate languages(those languages like  French, Italian, Portugueses, and Spanish  which originated from  Latin). This is generally true , as  the vast majority of poeple  there speak Spanish or Portuguese as  their    mother tongue. However, a number of small Caribbean  island nations were also  once  part of the British Empire;  accordingly因此,      their citizens  even  after independence speak English. These nations  include   Antigua and barbuda, the Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada,   Jamaica,Barbados, and the Republic of  Trinidad and Tobago.                                                                            


   Do the Caribbean English  speakers speak British English? Not exactly.  All  over  the world where English has been spoken for hundreds of years by speakers of other languages, certain(一些) special accents 口音  or dialects have arisen(arise产生). India is famous for "Indian English"; "Irish English" is  unmistakable, too. Likewise, Caribbean English  has its own  special patterns,         vocalulary, and even gramatical forms  different from  the standard RP(received pronunciation, also  referred to  as Received  Standard) of British English . There special features include a lilt  or  "sing-song" sound to the language, and plenty of  local  slang . 

   As only  a relatively few  people live on  these  inslands, how can we hear their  special dialect or accent?One kind of  pop music  called  reggae is the easiest way  outside of  befriending someone from these  naitons. Reggage music has been pupular since     the 1980's, when performers like  Bob Marley of Jamaica pleasantly  surprised the world with  their own original reggae music  as well as their  interpretations of other well-known pop Anglo music. Reggae is famous for  its strong, often syncopated beat,   laid-back  singing style, and ,of course, the " island" dialect.  Another   perennial music  favorite is calypso,  which is  als sung   in the Caribbean island English  dialect 方言. The hit song "Yes, We Have No Bananas," is reminiscent of 使人想起  this drum-heavy  musical style,  especially from  Trinidad and Tobago.
   
   Given the islands' historic ties to both the United Kingdom and the United States, it is  little wonder that today the peoples of  these  small  nations continue to use  English  in government, academia, business, and trade.Local [ˈloʊk(ə)l] languages still exist alongside  the Caribbean  English dialect , too. but they  are mostly  the  patois  of the marketplace and home. Many of the  residents of 居民  this area, also  referred to as  the West indies or the Antilles, have emigrated to  the U.K. or  the U.S. and, because of their  linguistic pwowess, have done  relatively well as so-called  "third world" immigrants. A few  writers of  contemporary renown also  hail from  this area,  as do  some sports figures.

    If you  plan to  visit  any of the above-memtioned island  for  any purpose, do not  worry about  your language skills . Caribbean  peoples are well-known  for their  friendly , patient dispositions. After a few  days, your ear  will become  attuned to  the liting  cadence of the lovely  Carbbean  English  dialects,and your  stay  in this tropical paradise will  be all  the more    rewarding.

** Lesson 10(tenth)  Marlena  Smalls  and  the Gullah: The Revival of a  Unique  Community  
  Sunday  auguest twenty-first

   Does  the name  Marlena Smalls   ring a   bell? Probably  not, At least not yet. If  this large woman  with an even larger  smile and sparking eyes has   her way,  however , the language,  customs, and songs of  the Gullah will  become happily familiar  to millions of  people  outside of the Sea Islands. For  it is Mrs. Smalls' dream  that through her  and her performing troupe's  efforts their Gulah community will no longer  be an  isolated,  anachronistic hangover from the days of slavery in the United  States, but a  vibrant cultural addition to the 21st century  global village.

   The  Sea Islands  comprise a group of islands just off  the  southeast  U.S. Atlantic coast of South Carolina and Georgia.    Descendants of slaves settled  here  tilling the fertile land of these  islands  and the adjacent coastline. A rich overlay  of a  mixture of West  African  languages  onto 17th and 18 th  century   colonial English  has resulted  in Gullah, a creole  language featuring its  unique  blend  of African  tongues  and  pidgin English . Thousands of distinct African words  coming  from various West African languages  have  been identified  by  linguists. A few  words  have been added into  contemporary  mainstream  American English . These include  goober(peanut), gumbo(okra), and voodoo(witchcraft). The word Gullah  itself also  hails from West Africa.  Many  of this  ethnic group's  given names are taken directly from languages passed down  for  hundreds of years,  such as Abiona and Ptitiap.  American English is the language  used  when  dealing with  outsiders, but Gullah is  the  language  of the marketplace and the home.

   As  with most African cultures, the  Gullah have a  rich  tradition of music. The  banjo, a stringed musical instrument, was   an African invention  brought over with  
 the slaves to the New World. It has  been popularized   in both  North America  and   Europe   over   the past  200 years. A great  variety  of drums,  too, accompanied    African music  to the colonies in  North  and South  America. Singing  both solo and a  cappella  with  rich harmonies  was also part of the slave heritage. Despite their   demanding  and depressing lives, the slaves  held their  original languages   and music  as  well  as their  masters'  Christianity close to  their   hearts.        Much  of the music  today  involves church music, also referred  to as spirituals or gospel music.

   An  evening  with Marlena Smalls  and her Hallelujah  Singers is nothing  short  of inspirational. They  are dressed  at times  in  traditional  African clothing, and at other  times  in the  simple  and conservative  rural  dress  of Southern U.S. society .  This  unusual performance  includes much singing frequent samples of Gullah as  used in  the marketplace or  between women gossiping. A great  deal of emphatic  body  language, and even occasional tribal dance steps to thumping drums and enthusiastic  shouting are also features  of the performance. Mrs.  Smalls  introduces  the background to  indivadual songs or other performances to help the audience -- often  peppered with overseas tourists   -- have a clearer  idea  of how the Gullah communicate to each other. Even without  the helpful introductions , howerve, music  lovers will appreciate the peerless singing quality of the Hallelujah Singers as they  render their  traditional folk songs with obvious love and pride. Interspersed with Mrs. Smalls with and  classy narrative, the evening passes all  too quickly.

   Paris, City of Light, and  of art.  A playland for  lovers and a painter's  dream. What  better  place  to situate the louvre, considered by many to be the world's  best  museum of  art? What  makes this museum so worthy fo that honor?

  The  museum building,  or, more properly, the  complex of buildings  themselves is a good place to start. As  with  most Western  and a few Asian and   South  American museums, large  palaces or other  traditional architecture are used   to house   museums  of  art and of natural science.  In  the case   of the Louvre,  officially known as   Paris du  Louvre (the Palace of the Louvre),  the main building used  today was  formerly the fortress of King  Philip Augustus in the 12th  century. Not until 1546 did  King Francis I begin  to redesign and add onto  the fortress. Subsequent kings  did   the same, especially  during the 17th century  with  major additions by  Louis XIII and Louis XIV.  Not only did  these  kings and their ministers add to the buildings , they also  stocked within their rooms  the finest art  that  money could buy.   After the  French  Revolution, the  Palais du Louvre  was   opened to the public. In the early 19th  century, both Napoleon and Napoleon III  added to both the structures and the collections . A controversial see-through glass  pyramid-shaped structure  was added by the architect I.m.Pet in the 1980s. As a  consequence of centuries  of continuous construction and amassing of art  treasures, today the Louvre offers a  world-class  collection   of both  French and foreign  art.

The  outer shell of a museum, however, no matter  how artistic or historic, cannot  alone make a museum truly great. The inner collections are of course of  paramount interest to both the   art researcher and art lover alike.  The Lovre does  not disappoint them.  Three  of the West's premier works of art are here: the statues VIctory of Samothrece and Venus de Milo accompany Leonardo DA vinci's  most famous painting,  the Mona Lisa. These alone  attract art devotees from around  the world, but far more awaits them. The French  painting  collection is ,  not  surprisingly, unsurpassed. Other major  painting collections include works from the middle ages and Renaissance. The treasures of the French royalty are on display here, too, such as their bronzes, miniatures, potery, tapestries, jewelry, and furniture. Greek, Roman, Egyptian , and Mesopotamian  antiquities as well as early Christian   artifacts  are also  considered important  collections. This  clearly is not a  museum to be seen in one morning!

 Finaly, the site of the museum complex  contributes to  the  mysigue of the Louvre. Paris has long been considered one of the world's most charming cities, with  its endless winding  streets amidst spectacular royal and religious architecture. The  fortress built by King Philip Auguestus was situated on  the right bank of the Seine, overlooking -- at that  time -- splendid  bucolic scenery. Today  this prime location is within walking   distance of many major Parisian tourist attractions, like the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the Royal Palace, and the National Library. One  could  easily spend a whold week touring the heart of  Paris centered around the Louvre.

  Taken  altogether, then , the Louvre holds its own as on  of the best museums -- if not  the best --among the dozens  of major  and internationally famous art museums  around the world. Its many and varied buildings, the unparalleled collection of prestigious works of art, and the delightful site of the grounds  overlooking France's  most famous river all contribute to make the Palais duLouvre a must-see  attraction for the serious art connoisseur and art museum-goer alike.

 The first permanent English settlement in the New World was  at Plymouth Bay in what  is now  the state  of Massachusetts  in 1620. Merely 16 years later, a group of successful settlers in New Town(renamed Cambridge after their  alma mater) started a college. They named it after the Puritan minister  who  willed half his  estate and all his books to  the college  This  clergyman's  name was John  Harvard, and  his namesake  remains the most prestigious among the more than 2,000  institutes of higher  education  in the United States today.

 Harvard is  not the only great school in the U.S. , of course. A  small industry has  grown  up around the ranking of the best tertiary schools,and year  after year,seven  schools dominate  most of these Top Twenty or Top Fifty lists. Harvard is nearly  always at or close to the top, joined frequently by Yale(in Connecticut),Princeton(in New Jersey), Dartmouth(in New Hampshire),Cornell(in New York State), Columbia(in New York City), the University  of Pennsylvania, and Brown(in Rhode  Island).  These eight private universities are collectively referred to  as the Ivy League schools.

 Why  the name ? Ivy  is a vine; that is, a plant which grows  up or along the surface of other plants such as trees, or , in the  human landscape,  along the sides of stone buildings. As these  eight  universities are old(the youngest among them,Cornell, was  founded in 1853),ivy has had  plenty of time to decorate the outsides of the more historic buildings on these campuses. The  word league, however, is more an invention of imagination  than  a reality . Though  there is an association called the Ivy League, it refers to the above schools's  participation in an Amercan  football   athletic conference rather  than  to any academic alliance. Further, despite the  lengthy academic  lineage of these  schools,  the footballing Ivy League was not  formally formed until 1956, though highly competitive football and other athletic games have been hotly contested among the schools for many generations.

vine [vaɪn] n.藤；藤蔓   ivy  [ˈaɪvi] n.【植】常春藤

    Since  these institutes of higher  learning   had such an early  start in the  history of the United States,  it  is  not surprising  that they  should individually and collectively have  exerted  a great influence on American society. Their status within   national scholarly circles is unparalleled .  Admission to these  universities is  highly demanding: many  students apply for every  one lucky enough to be accepted. As these  universities are  private, they are relatively expensive. Offsetting the extremely  high  tuition are many opportunities for scholarships. These  scholarships are awarded to meritorious students regardless of their  backgrounds.

  Additionally,  the  roster of the faculties of these  schools  reads  like  a  Who's Who list of   important Americans(and  quite  a few foreigners, as well).  Their  intellectual  integrity  shows in the number  of Nobel and other  major prizes  awarded  which  they  have garnered over  the years. Some  of the country's  most famous  doctors, statesmen, engineers, scientists, and educationists  have studied and taught within  these  ivy-covered walls.  No fewer  than 14 U.S. presidents have  earned degrees here,including six at Harvard, six at Yale,and two  at Princeton.

integrity [ɪnˈteɡrəti]n.完整；诚实正直；完好  garner [ˈɡɑrnər]收集

  
  Though  only a   select few  can join the  ranks as Ivy Leaguers each year, Americans are endowed  with a  world-class  tertiary  educational  system  second  to none.  Note every  graduate from an Ivy League  school "makes the grade" in life;   even   a first-rate education is no guarantee  of success. Still, those  who do  enter  and leave  the Ivy  League  universities in the  northeastern  United States  have a much  better   than   average  chance  to join  the ranks fo the movers and shakers of   not only the U.S. society, but,once  back  in their   home countries, of their  native   lands as well.

** Lesson 15  Webcames: Electronics Tools  or  the End of Privacy?
  What are webcams? The  word webcam  is a  compound word formed from  two abbreviations, "web" from the World Wide Web and "cam" from camera. Webcams are cameras which  are situated at various places and  linked to the  World Wide Web. They allow 24-hour viewing of a wide array of places and activities around the world. They can be as educational as they  are fascinating, entertaining as they are eye-opening. Not everyone raves about this new technology,   however. Some cite sinister implications in a technology which  can unobtrusively spy  on our goings-on without our permission.  Others note  that with  rapid increases in telephotography and the science of acoustics, the days of privacy are numbered. Anyone can mount a webcam with  a telephoto  lens and microphone, aim it at his neighbors's liveing room or bedroom, and the broadcast one's "private" life to the  whole world. A script for the next scifi film, or a  current reality? Are these doomsayers overreacting, or is  their  charge(指控) legitimate ?

     On one side of the  debate are those who point  out that webacms offer more  real  advantages thant supposed disadvantages. They  cite numerous websites on which people  can  observe the world around  them for educational or aesthetic purposes. Today one  can watch  urban scenes like  city streets and squares  or even haunted houses! Nature lovers   can revel in the undetectable  webcasting of bats, sharks, and  penguins at various sites around the world. A huge collection of webcams can be found at www.earthcam.com . Another  great  collection  can be viewed at www.discovery.com. Most educators, parents, and politicians  would  agree  that  these   websites allow  for a  better  understanding of both the human  and  natural environments in the world we all live in. Certainly, the world say, webcams provide an invaluable service and  should  not be restricted.

Railroads  gave  us faster and more convenient  transportation as they  simultaneously signaled  the death knell of many  species of  migratory animals as well  as served up noise and air pollution.

   Opponents of webcams  note  that  the sleazy, commercial instinct of some people   is unleashed with the offering of for-pay viewing of certain starlets  or other  celebrities' home    lives, which most people  prefer to think   of as their "private"   life. Perhaps not much longer. In some controversial cases, webcams have been mounted in  public  installations such as washrooms so that voyeurs may watch the intimate goings-on of anonymous people. Even  more sinister is the capacity for  the new technology  to be used in both economic espionage  and "good old"  state-to-state  spying. Webcams mounted surreptitiously in   business  offices or factories can reveal on-screen "secrets" from those unaware that they are being  bugged. Wich microelectronics technology reducing the size of  telecommunications devices, this is no paranoid fantasy any longer.

    The human mind is as devious as the many progressive  devices it produces. No matter what technology mankind  develops in the future, we can be sure that it will offer and  opportunity to exercise the dark side of our potential. On balance, we must move forward and allow these new technologies.  Only by practicing them -- for good or bad --can we realize our human potential. On  balance, too, despite   the horrific deadly or sinister potential in  technology,  the world offers a more productive, comfortable, and progressive  environment today that in our previous low-tech centuries.

**  Lesson 16 When  Is the Best Time ?
  Some  poeple  go so far as to say that  time does not really exist; It is  all in the mind, they claim.Others note that according to  astrophysicists, time  really does exist; It is  inseparable from space,coexisting in what  these scientists call the "time-space continuum" . No  matter which view you may hold, time is of  relative importance in  different  cultures. However, when  traveling ,doing  business, or studying  in a German or English-speaking country, it is a good idea to consider time to be of the utmost importance.

  Many people have noted that  the  germans  and English  are both  methodical and well-organized.  Naturally, not everyone among  them is ,but these peoples do seem to  share a penchant for orderliness  and  punctuality.      Clocks and time have played a great  part  in defining the character  of the  Anglo-Saxons. The  geographic use of time  began during the British  Empire  with  the world  divided by latitude and longitude , with  zero  degrees longitude    running through the observatory at Greenwich , in London. According to  the British of that day, the world began its  timekeeping from London  and  it still does.  Time is of paramount importance  to these  Europeans and their overseas descendants. If you are visiting or  staying  in these  countries, here  are a  few pieces of advice to help you make the transition to a time-centered civilization.

  methodical 美: [məˈθɑdɪk(ə)l] adj.有条理的；有条不紊的；办事有条不紊的   网络有方法的；有系统的；井然的

   As  you  probably already know, being  punctual --to the minute --- is held  in  high esteem among them. Time is the most valuable commodity  one can have,  according to the  doctrine of  the time worshippers . We are not given very much  of it whilst on this planet, and we should do our best to utilize it efficiently  each and every day, the say . Wasting  others' time by forcing them  to wait is a sign of disorganized living, a sort of admission  to being low-class. It is also  seem  as an insult to  those kept waiting, as if to say, "Your time is not that  important."To them, this attitude borders on sin itself! In business, being late even only a few times may make the difference between  your  getting a promotion and being kept "in your place." For social dates, it is a sign of slovenliness at best, rejection of those waiting at worst. In school, never  burst open the door of the lecture hall to announce, "I'm sorry  I'm late,sir" as is the custom in many countries, The  double crime of being tardy and interrupting the proceedings which  began on time  occurs, with a likely prejudiced  and  unfavorable grade awaiting  the hapless student.

  Of course, being  late can sometimes not be avoided , as in unexpected traffic jams,home  emergencies, or having   been  given the wrong  information of date or place. When  these  all-too-human  mishaps do occur ,  it is important to explain the reason for being late. It is also a good idea, Of course ,to apologize for the useless waiting and to assure  the other or  others that it  will never happen again. In this age of cell phones, every effort shoudl be made to call ahead if tardiness of more than ten minutes is unavoidable, especially for business or professional  appointments or important  dates. The  last phrase anyone  wants to hear is a frosty "You could  have called."  That  is the prelude to a ruined evening.

 Not   everything  begins  exactly on time, even in  Anglo-Saxon  culture. Many  casual  parties are "open" concerning time; the party begins when you get  there. The  same  is generally true  of backyard  barbecues and picnics. Dinner parties, on the other hand , are obviously planned around a meal time; one should make every effort  to arrive  (not before). A friendly "Drop by this evening" invites common sense to interpret: too earyly during the evening may  embarrass the host who is  eating dinner, while too late  may disturb  those who  prefer  going  to bed earyl. A call first to make sure is never out of line .

 disturb      美: [dɪˈstɜrb]  v.打扰；干扰；弄乱；妨碍

  Remember that  time is relative in importance to people  within a  culture just  as it is between  cultures.  Nothing  is more importance than  human relations. If you  commit the "crime" of  being late  with Anglo-Germanic friends, simply apologize. Few  people intentionally keep  others waiting, after all. Remember, too, that, "When in Rome,do as the Romans do."  In  English-and German-speaking lands, this means "Time waits for no man!"

**  Lesson 18  Hot Animals Around the  World: The Koala
   Why  are all those people  standing in line in the hot sun at the zoo? Maybe  the zoo just opened  a koala exhibit. With  the survival rate  of native  Australian koalas on the rise,  more  and more  zoos around the world are  adding  a  "koala house" or  "koala exhibit" to their roster of special animals. And   the people  keep coming,  whether merely to catch a glimpse of one or , if really lucky  at zoos  which permit it , to hold  and be photographed with one.

   Why   are  koalas among the  most beloved fo all animals ? At  times   referred to as " koala bear," this Australian marsupial is not a bear at all. It is one of  few tailless mammals besides  the apes and man. Yet  apes are not often  considered cuddly; indeed, they  are often  feared for being either too large or too naughty. This  Australian  real-life teddy  bear, instead , is the best of all worlds: it is quiet , soft, neither too large nor too small (adults are usually 65 to  80 cm. long), and really  cuddly! With  its  soft fur, leathery nose, rounded  ears, and big eyes, most people  seem  to melt when near one.  Its  disposition is  perfect  for   children and adults alike;   it rarely makes a fuss, even   when  being held. (Try  that  with  a baby  tiger!) No  wonder the  lines  to see,  hold, or just  touch the  koalas are always among the longest at zoos.

   One  reason zoos  today  are able  to keep  koalas  is the  rise in the koala population  in its native habitat, the eucalyptus forests of  southeastern  Australia. This  nation, famous for its  unique  fauna and flora, is now allowing applications for the professional export of its  protected species to overseas  zoological gardens. Once   hunted for its fur, this arboreal leaf-eater  is today  protected by stringent laws and is making a slow but steady comeback.  Indeed , everything about   the koala  seems slow. It sleeps more than  12 hours a day(often  much more), eats only choice leaves from  eucalyptus(which  can now be grown  in many zoos  to provide the more than  one kilogram of leaves that  each adult koala needs per day), and rarely  if at all  descends to the ground because it is such a  slow runner(from wild Australian dogs called dingoes ro from human hunters). As  kialas  are such  a great draw for visitors,  many zoos are trying to include  them  among their species.

   Mother koalas   give  birth to babies only  every other year. These young ones,as  with other  marsupials,spend a period of  time inside the mother's  "pouch"  before venturing out into  the world. In the case of the koala, this pouch  is located below and in back of the mother; the  small koals can climb out directly  from the puch and onto  the mother's  back  before learning to  feed  and feed for  themselves. With  all other  marsupials, the pouch is located in the front , perhaps most famously with  the kangaroo, where  the "joey"  can  sometimes be seen  popping  its head out of it soft, warm pouch to survey  the world  about it safely. 


   pouch US [paʊtʃ] n.荷包；邮袋；小袋子；（有袋目动物腹部的）育儿袋


   Until the 1980s, zoologists feared  that the  koala might go the way of some other   rare marsupials. Just  as their eucalyptus  habitat  was  being destroyed to make room  for the ever-increasing suburban Australians, diseases peculiar to koalas began  to  take their toll.  Combined with weak or non-existent  laws against the hunting or poaching of  this national treasure, the koala seemed doomed to extinction.  Today , the koala has climbed back from the brink  of extinction and is  thriving again.  Its main  enemy today is forest fires. This  slow-moving mammal  cannot move quickly enough to escape the  deadly fires  which  perennially ravage the land. With  more  land being  set aside to  protect this  and  other  Australian species, however, the future  of much of this special land's  animal wealth seems secure.

   All animals deserve man's  protection, but some  animals seem to attract the attention they  need. The  koala  , one of  the symbols of the great Down Under, is one of  these . Holding a  koala is fun, educational, and inspiring. If  Australians could cooperate to save  this special species, mankind  should be able  to prevent the extinction   of all other  animals, too.
   

   
**  Lesson  19  Asian Americans
  In the  last census  conducted  by  the U.S. government in 1990, one fact caught many people  by surprise; the  percentage  of Asian  Americans  had grown faster than  any other  segment  of the  population. European  Americans had, as expected, continued their  slow decline in percentage   of  the total U.S. population, though they were still dominant at about 76%.  Black Americans  had stabilized  at about 12% of  the population. Hispanics had  continued their fast growth and were, at 9%, aimed at  toppling  Black   Americans as the country's  largest  minority group. The growth in Asian  Americans, however,  surged from  only 2% of the  total U.S. population in the  1980 census  to  3% in 1990. By  the year 2000  at least 4% of Americans will be of  Asian ancestry. This  relatively huge  increase has caught  many demographers  by  surprise. Clearly  a  new force  is developing in U.S. demography, but few  people  seem  to appreciate its   implications .  The  Asian Americans are here  and are here  to stay, but exactly who are they, and what  does their rapid  increase mean for  the country as a whole ?

   As  a multi-ethnic  nation, it should not be surprising that  Asian  Americans are becoming  an increasingly large  and important  sector  of the "rainbow nation"  some   
 Americans  prefer to  think  of their  country as.  Indeed  the only surprise   about  this segment growing so fast   is why  it has not  occurred   sooner. After all,Asia is home  to 60% of all the people  in the world. However , Asia  is also a vast land, encompassing East,  Southeast , South ,  and West Asia, each region   
 significantly  different  from  its  neighbors. Further, there is  no sense of unity within Asia, as there is , say ,among European or Latin American countries . Indeed ,   the term "Asian Americans" is    more  a fiction  of the European mind, since people  from this area unfailingly  refer to   themselves as Chinese, Japanese, Filipino , etc . rather  than   as Asian-Americans.

  For more than   100 years, three primary groups of Asians  emigrated to the  United States: Japanese,Chinese,and Filipino. However, since the end of the  Vietnam War, other groups from  Asia  have  become increasingly  prominent, especially those  from Vietnam, Korea,  and India. In addition,  Iranians  and Israelis from Southwestern Asia have also  entered  the U.S. in large  numbers.

  The patterns of Asian immigration  have changed  greatly  over  the past 30 years. In 1970, 96% of Asian Americans were  Chinese , Japanese, or Filipino; as of  1997, this percentage  had dropped to 55%! In that year, 24% of Asian Americans  claimed Chinese ancestry, 21% Filipino, and 10% Japanese.  The "newcomers" among Asian Americans  include  the Indians at 13 %, Vietnamese at 11%, and Koreans also at 11%.

  What  real numbers are we talking about? There were  estimated to be nearly 9,600,000 Asian Americans  in the U.S. in  1997. With such  a high  growth rate, there  will    be  more than  10 million of them this year and perhaps 32 million in 2050(about 8%  of  the total U.S. population at that time). Where  do   Asian Americans  live ?  Currently, an astounding 40% of this regional group  lives in California. Other  states with  relatively  large Asian American  populations  include  New York,Hawaii,Texas,New Jersey Washington (the state), and lllinois (which contains Chicago). Overall, the West is home  to 54% of all Asian Americans, the Northeast 19%, the South 16%, and the Midwest 11%.

astounding [əˈstaʊndɪŋ] adj.使大吃一惊的 regional [ˈridʒən(ə)l] adj.地区的；区域的
relatively [ˈrelətɪvli]  adv.相当程度上；相当地； contain  [kənˈteɪn] v.包含；能
Chicago [ʃɪ'kɑ:ɡoʊ] n.芝加哥 Overall 总体 
  
  What about future  trends ? As Asian nations continue  to prosper, it is likely  that  will contribute  more to U.S. immigration, especially from Southeast Asia and India.  All of  these groups continue to have above-average birth rates. On the other hand, Chinese and Japanese Americans have very  low birth rates; consequently, the percentage of these  ethnic  groups  among  the total will continue tho fall. All in all, American can look forward  to an  increasingly  large  number of Asians  enriching their new home  with their diligence, investment, and diverse cultural  contributions.

**  Lesson 20 Scourage  of the Plains:  Tornadoes 

  Ellen Mae  stepped  out of  her  two-story home in central  Illinois  "Fine morning " she  said  to herself after checking the weather , and   then  went back inside. The radio  had  mentioned  a severe storm  advisory, but the sky was  clear, and it was  rather calm.  Still, she decided to be safe  and kept her radio on.

  About  noon  she felt a strange kind  of pressure. Looking out  her  window, she noticed the sky had become overcast.  Low, rounded, oddly colored clouds were  forming. It was  still  and  oppressvie. "Maybe I'd better    listen to the weather report again,"  she murmured to herself.

   Again the radio   forecast severe  weather, warning citizens  to listen for   the siren and seek shelter should a  twister, scourge  of the plains, come  down from the heavens like a  "Devil's tail" "I doubt  it'll  happen over Crossville," she comforted herself. "It always happens in other towns."
   

   By  two o'clock it started to  rain, and the wind picked  up,too. The  apple tree in front  of Ellen   Mae's house started to  pitch  back and forth violently. Her  dogs started  to bark  and howl,  and that  was when   she heard  that   awful sound.

   At first  she  thought it was  a locomotive, but she  quickly  remembered that  there  was no  railroad within  20 miles of her home.  She  looked  into the sky and then  noticed it, a dark,  swirling mass of black cloud sucking up everything  it  touched  and hurling objects  at horrific speeds straight  up  or straight  to the side.  Ellen  Mae  ran as fast as she could down into her  storm cellar, a special room  which   had  been prepared by  her father when  he was still  alive.  This  room  was  located in the south western corner  of the basement and  had  a door  with a  strong bolt. Ellen Mae  ran in , locked  the door behind her, and waited.

   She  didn't   have long  to wait. With  shrieking and   swooshing   sounds right out  of hell, the funnel cloud  passed  directly over her house. An  enormous vacuum cleaner, the twister  blew   the house  apart, scattering five generations of Ellen Mae's family belongings over half  the rural county  she lived in. Within  minutes, the winds had stopped, and an eerie silence replaced  the cacophony of  moments earlier.  Feeling it was now   safe  to venture out , Ellen Mae unbolted the door, peered out, and started to cry. She could look straight up into the sky. Even thought  she  had lost her house and everyting in it, she felt lucky, She knew taht every year,  hunreds of poeple   could perish in  tornadoes .

    Just what are  these "devil storms"? They  go by many names  across the Great Plains of the United States and  Canada,not to mention many other  countries arond the world, but tornadoes are perennial plagues in central North  America. The conditions  there - flat land and proximity to cold  air masses(from the Rocky Mountains to the west) and  warm  and humid air masses(from  the Gulf of Mexico to the  south) provide the optimum   breeding ground for tornadoes. According to the U.S. National Weather Service, tornadoes form  from  thunderclouds  and can reach swirling  speeds in excess of 600  kilometers per hour.    They last from minutes to an hour or more and  can blast their way across as much as 150 kilometers  of terrain at about 50 kilometers per hour. They vary in width from  a few meters to 1,500 meters(average 200 meters). And  they  strike fear  into the hearts of everyone.

   The  safest place to be when a tornado is in one's area is a  basement, preferrably the sourthwest corner (where the tornado  normally comes from). If driving, track  due  north or south, as tornadoes usually move from west to east. Weather prediction  and tracking these days is far superior to earlier years, but  tornadoes can appear  without any warning at all, as a  large  one did  right in the heart of Salt Lake City  in 1999,leaving a trail  of shocked , wounded, and dead as well as pulverized property.

  The author, Herman Melville, was born in New York on  Auguest 1,1819.  As  a youth in a large family he suffered many  insecurities due to the family's  constantly  changing fortunes. As a young man he worked as a farmer and seaman, the latter providing most of the material for several of  his  later novels  and essays. In his 20s Melville found fame  with two novels based on   imaginary happenings in the South Pacific. Moby Dick, ironically, was not well received Afterwards, Melville produced another masterpiece, Billy Budd. He continued writing until his death in 1891 .

  Why has Moby  Dick since  become such  a  classic despite its  initial  lukewarm reception? Melville had a  keen eye  for not only the human  condition  but for  the tenor of his times: the United States was  in his  day a country of  disadvantaged and  mistreated immigrants (many of whom became sailors and laborers), with  untrammeled capitalism crushing both nature  and  man underneath its new country exuberance. His stress on the  individual and  fate -- often  pessimistically, or  at least  realistically - were harbingers of the future  of literature.

  Why  does the story of Moby Dick continue to enthrall generation after  generatio? The story line is  simple enough: a mad sea captain vows revenge against a white whale which, on a  previous expedition, bit off one of his legs.   In his  vain attempt at "justice" against nature, the captain meets the ultimate tragedy. This  was no documentary, however; the characters and setting become vehicles for far larger and more  universal themes of the setbacks and successes of the human  spirit as well as its darker urges. So  accurately does Melville  depict the whaling scenes and sea voyages that the reader is taken  on an  exhilarating  ride.Coupled with the absorbing,mad Captain Ahab, the book is "a good read" even by 20th  century standards.

  Earlier last century, the Noble Prize winner Ernest  Hemingway penned The Old Man  and the Sea, another story of a man's struggle  with nature on the open ocean. This  theme strikes a chord in Americans,   whose culture  developed  along the Atlantic coast of North  America  and whose seaward  passage  from the Old World took them to the colonies of the 18th century or the young country of the 19th century by the millions. This fascination withe the maritime still holds today: over half the population of the United States lives in counties  touching the Atlantic, Pacific, or Gulf coasts. Perhaps some future wirter will once again use the metaphor of sailors and the sea  to create yet another Great American Novel.

  When people  think  of "American culture and values,"  they  are unconsciously  referring to a set of principles, a world view, and a lifestyle  which can  best be found in Boston,capital of the state of Massachusetts  and the major  city in all  of  New England, those six  relatively samll states tucked away in the northeastern  corner of the United States. Although  Boston is perhaps the seventh  or eighth  largest city in the U.S.,no  other  city in America  can compare  with the influence which Boston has  had  on the development of government, education, medicine, and the arts.

  This  influence  is due  in no small part  to Boston's  central role  in the building of  a new nation.  Many people  think  that the United States was  established in 1776; however, that  was the year  of  the Declaration of Independence, a  revolutionary   document claiming self-rule from its mother  country , England.  Actual  independence--the formation of a  government with an acting president(George Washington) -- did not begin until 1789. Boston was nearly   middle-aged then, as it  had had its beginnings a  century  and  a half earlier,in 1630. It maintained its  position  as the colonies' pre-eminent  center for politics, education , and  commerce until  the  mid-18th century, when  both New York and Philadelphia(the young nation's first and second capitals,respectively) overtook Boston in size .

  Boston  was  settled by religious immigrants from  the Church of English. It was  with these  early settlers that the first  outlines of an American  culture  began: a  strict  adherence to religious dicta, diligence in work, educational aspirations,  and a conservative  lifestyle. Because Boston  is closer to Europe  than any  other  city  in the U.S., it  was the point  of entry to the colonies  until  the 19th century, when  New york became the  new magenet  for the "poor, tired, and huddled  masses"  who  were  to become  the backbone of the new  American  economy, Boston remained, however , and important commercial center until  the 20th century .

  Today Boston  caters  to finance and  banking, education, and medicine, with some of the top international  mutual fund and insurance companies, world-renowned educational   institutes, and state-of-the-art  medical centers   and schools.  The  city has  also  managed to preserve  much of its earlier identity  as the  home of the American Revolution; thus  tourism is  an important sector in the economy of Boston as  well. Like  San Francisco or New  Orleans, Boston has a  reputation  for being a pleasant city  to admire while walking around it.


  What  can one do in Boston? Important   historic sites, well-preserved examples  of architecture from  the 17~20th centuries, and spacious parks  invite the  tourist or resident to "smell the roses"  while in Boston. Its unhurried but sophisticated citizens boast  not only  high incomes but also high  levels of education. Music flourished here: the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New  England  Conservatory of Music  and the Boston Pops  Orchestra offer  first-class musical entertainment in both public and private venues. The  Museum of Fine  Arts is a major world gallery. Science Park, situated  midway between Boston and its major satellite city, Cambridge , offers the Museum  of  Science. Had  enough  of "high-brow  culture"? Boston  affords it s citizens and visitors many first-class  restaurants and shopping  dockside in Faneuil  Hall. HiSTORIC walking  tours are a  must for the tourist, especially   Boston Commons, a city  park, and Beacon Hill, with  its  roads  still paved with the   original stones from the 17th century.

  Remember  when the  1980s  brought us  the first  wave  of the modern  computer and  electronics revolutions ? At  that  time , heady young technocrats foresaw  "the  paperless office."

  The  reality today is quite different.   More   paper than even   is being  used in offices, schools,  and residential homes.  One's  first  possession in life is a  birth certificate, made  of paper.  Childhood  immunizations are recorder on  paper  and kept in the doctor's  office and at home. What  would  school be like  without  paper? Paper  follows most people  throughtout  their  education  and into  their  working life. Wedding  invitations  and marriage certificates are printed on paper, as are virtually  all major life passages and  social occasions. Finally,  a  death certificate on paper  will continue  to be  around long after the  person  named   on it. Perhaps  the one  item  which  defines  modern  civilization  more that  any other is  paper.

  The  world  paper derives from papyrus, the name  of a  riverside plant similar to grass, from which an   ancient form  of paper was used in Egypt and   Mesopotamia. It could be  argued  that  these  empires were  made  possible by the use  of official  records on papyrus. However, paper  as we know it today  has its origins in the Han  dynasty of China . In  about A.D. 105 , an  official in the imperial court produced the  forebear of what has become  today  the world's  most indispensable product.  The  art  of paper making reached  westwards to Baghdad, Iraq in the   8th  century at the  height of the  Islamic culture. From  there  it entered Europe , where is  was polished into its contemporary   form during the 19th   century.

   Paper can be  made from any plant,  but trees  are the best source of cellulose  for paper production.  In fact, earlier forms of paper were made from processed cotton waste and rags,  but trees contain a better proportion and type  of cellulost  than  any other plant. In countries with  a deficiency of  forest land,  other  natural fibers such as  sugar cane pulp ,bamboo, cereal straws , flax, and hemp are  used.  Today's paper  and paper product mills rely  on a steady inflow of wood  logs or chips. In  the United  States alone,  the  paper and paper  products industry   is  worth  more  thant  US$80 billion , with  world  production  well  over  1000,000,000  tons annually.

    Everyone  knows what  paper is , since  most people  use at   least  one sheet of it a day , but few  people  stop  to consider the different kinds  of paper  available to us  today . Office  workers   are well aware  of the many  kinds of  paper they   use,  such as  regular typing or computer printing  or copier paper.  They  also  come into  contact with bond, a high-grade paper used for  important documents. It is  thicker and more durable than other  forms of paper.  Book paper comes in at least four different  finishes, These may be  seen in books, magazines, brochures,  and calendars, Newsprint is used  for newspapers and some  magazines or books, while kraft  paper  is used for shopping    bags.  Paperboard is seen  daily as  bo lunch containers,  cardboard boxes, and even  building materials. Finally ,sanitary  paper has been developed for use in tissue paper, paper toweling, and paper napkings. Carbon paper, postcards, and envelopes are also dialy  use items  made  of  paper.  Even a tea  bag  is made of paper!

    Paper and its products seem endless ,but conservation of even the  abundant resource of  trees is in everyone's interest.  Recycling of paper   and better  designed pulp and paper factories have helped decrease waste.  Many  offices encourage   the use of  both sides of  a piece of paper, for example , and  students  or private  organizations  sometimes collect  old newsprint to send to reprocessing center. By conserving paper, the average paper user in his lifetime  can  save at least one tree from being  felled. As valuable as trees  are,  and as valuable as paper is , everyone  should  cooperate  to use this essential  commodity wisely.

** Lesson twenty-four  Coffee  or Tea Break?  May 19 2023 
   Do you prefer a coffee break or a tea break? Are  you getting off  the lift at the  groud floor, or are you going  to get off the  elevator on the first floor? Travelers to English-speaking countries have to adjust  to differences between  British  and American  English . There are also cultural  traditions to  understand , ways of life which  differ between London and New York ,Auckland and Toronto,and Sydney and San Francisco. Learning these  differences is fun, and, when you  travel to different  English-speaking  countries, it's very useful.    adjust[əˈdʒʌst]v.调整；调节；适应；习惯 校正   

   So, what is  a  coffee or a tea break? Americans and Canadians perfer coffee drinking  to tea  drinking . Tea lovers need  not worry, though; millions of  North Americans dring tea  and only tea every day. Though teahouses are  rare there, every supermarket  has a wide variety of Far Eastern, South Asia,  and herbal teas to choose from, Still, coffee is the preferred drink in the Americas; after all , South America if one of the world's  greatest coffee-producing areas. One social custom is  the U.S. and Canada is the mid-morning and mid-afternoon coffee break. This is very informal; it may be  spontaneous (Hey! Let's  break for coffee) or institutionalized (The coffee break in our  office is from 3:30-3:50 daily). Coffee (or tea)  may be  drunk only, or , more likely, a selection of baked goods such  as doughnuts, cookies, slices of cake, or crackers will be available, too.  These  breaks are not only  for  eating and  drinking but also for chatting.

rare [rer] adj.稀有的;珍贵的;稀少的   variety  [vəˈraɪəti]n.(同一事物的)不同种类，多种式样;变化;多
herbal [ˈɜːrbl]adj.药草的;香草的 n.草本植物志
spontaneous [spɑːnˈteɪniəs] adj. 自发的;非筹划安排的
institutionalized  [ˌɪnstɪˈtuːʃənəlaɪzd] adj.制度化的;约定俗成的;成惯例的
cracker [ˈkrækər] n.薄脆饼干

   In great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, people prefer a spot of tea during their tea  break in the mid-morning or mid-afternoon, and  later  on at home, they  have  high  tea in  the early  evening. High tea consists of a light,  cold meal or baked goods, followed by a more substantial meal later in the evening, Tea breaks may be formal in homes, with a silver tray filled  with  tea cups on saucers, a silver bowl with sugar, and s silver pitcher with cream brought into a living room, dining room, or drawing room. Baked goods are also served at tea breaks. In both the U.K . and  the U.S as well as in other English-speaking countries, most people eat three full meals daily,  but stopping for coffee or tea breaks has also become customary. 

spot [spɑːt] n.斑点;污迹, 污渍太黑点（人体的）部位, 地方
substantial  [səbˈstænʃl]adj.大量的;价值巨大的;重大的;大而坚固的;结实的;牢固的

pitcher [ˈpɪtʃər] n.投掷者;投球手;(尤指旧时的)带柄的陶罐

   Another useful difference to understand between  the British and American ways of life concerns traffic, which is of  the  utmost importance to travelers or visitors  .In London , one takes the underground, whereas in New York it's the subway(whether or not traveling below the ground). Streetcars are taken in American cityes, but trams are found in Britain. Make sure  you fill up with  gas at the gas station in Miami, but in Manchester you should  top up the  tank with petrol  at the petrol station.  Not sure  whether you need oil ? Check  under the bonnet in Bristol but  the hood  in Houston. Check  your wing mirror in Wales but your side  mirror in Rochester, And watch  out  for those traffic circles in Tampa  but those roundabouts in Reading.

petrol [ˈpetrəl] n.汽油      tank [tæŋk]n.坦克;(贮放液体或气体的)箱，槽，罐;
bonnet    US: [ˈbɑnət] 车辆的）引擎盖

consternation [ˌkɑnstərˈneɪʃ(ə)n] n.惊愕；惊恐Web惊惶失措
mandarin  [ˈmændərɪn] n.(中文)普通话;政界要员  
various  [ˈveriəs]adj.各种各样的，不同的;不止一个的
dialect  [ˈdaɪəlekt] n.地方话;土话;方言

  It should not surprise anyone  that  British and American English  are a little different grammatically (Americans say, "I don't have"  and "I have a lot" but the British say "I haven't" and "I have much"  ). Their pronunciation and vocabulary  also differ. These  should  not be sources of consternation when you visit different  Anglo countries; instead they  should be occasions  for  adventure and enjoyment, Just  as Mandarin-speaking  foreigners can   manage  their  way through  the various dialects of Mandarin  spoken in mainland  China, so , too , should anyone versed in conversational English -- for  any strip --  succeed in  having fun with the different worlds of English .


**  Lesson  25 Earthquake Precautions 
    17分后没声音了
   Bam! The  bathroom door  slamming against the wall woke me out of a  sound  sleep. Groggily wending my way  in the  dark  to the bathroom, I secured  the door  latch to make sure I would have no  further  interruptions of much-needed  sleep.

  Not for long. My body , the bed and the whole bedroom  began shaking. After a few  confused  and frightening seconds, I realized   "Earthquake!" "Big one" I added, noting  that  the neighborhood dogs had joined in the weird sounds the hills around my house were making. Within  moments I was  out of  bed and on my feet, contemplating leaving the house. "I'll wait", I comforted myself. "Even these  big ones  pass in a few seconds."

  This one wouldn't , It kept coming;everything was  shaking and trembling,  rattling,  I heard  a pane of glass crash  onto the floor.

The next day  I  learned that a 7.6 Richter-scale earthquake had devastated the lovely  rural communities  of central  Taiwan.

** Lesson   26   Berries: Nature's Natural Desserts

  The last child has left  the house for school. The  table is clean and neatly set, and the  coffee is brewing . The  cool orange juice  stands like a sentry over the tableware. Mother sits down , pours cereal into  a bowl, and sprinkles  it lightly with sugar. She  is then  ready for the final masterpiece. She  carefully spoons pre-cut ruby strawberries onto the mound of golden corn flakes. Pouring ivory-white milk  over the  concoction, Mother smiles to herself. An attractive, nutritious  breakfast fit for a  queen.

 Most  people  around the world  are now familiar  with and can enjoy  strawberries, but few are familiar with  other more exotic berries, such as   the  gooseberry, blackberry, and raspberry. Indeed, even  fewer  people realize  what the word berry  technically refers  to.  The  berry of the botanist and  the berry of the public  are often  two  quite different fruits.

 exotic  [ɪɡˈzɑtɪk] n.舶来品；外来物；adj.异国风味的

 Those  whose  specialty is plants define a berry  as s simple, fleshy fruit with a thin wall and many seeds.  Under this classification  are several surprises.  One  would  expect that cranberries are berries, of  course, but  less obvious  members of this class are dates, grapes, tomatoes, and even potatoes,  bananas, and  asparagus! Indeed , according to  botanists, some popular "berries" are not true berries at all.  Experts in plant life  consider the blueberry an  "inferior berry"  and  the  strawberry, raspberry, and  blackberry an "aggregate fleshy fruit."  However no matter  how  scientists call them , most people think of berries as small, round sweet, and  delicious fruits.

 those  [ðəʊz] adj.那些(的) . fleshy  [ˈfleʃi] adj.多肉的；肥胖的；肉质的
expect [ɪkˈspekt] v.期望；预 .  expert  [ˈekˌspɜrt]  专家n.内行；技师

  Berries such as strawberries , blackberries, respberries, and blueberries prefer cool and moist growing  conditions. Though they  rarely thrive in tropical conditions ,they  can  be  grown on the sides of taller  hills  and mountains there. Several  species  of wildlife  forage  for berries , the largest of these being  the bear.  Some  smaller mammals and  birds, too, enjoy  berries ,not to mention  people. Wild berries are noticeable smaller than  their  domesticated  cousins,  but many people  prefer the full,  rich taste of  freshly  picked forest berries.

moist  [mɔɪst]     adj.微湿的； rarely  [ˈrerli] adv.很少；罕有
thrive  [θraɪv] v.繁荣；茁壮成长；蓬勃;  tropical  [ˈtrɑpɪk(ə)l]adj.热带的；来

 Besides being  a condiment on breakfast  cereals(麦片), are there  any other  uses  for berries? Westerners make good  use of their local fruits.  Jellies, jams, and preserves can be easily made with berries, gelatin,  and sugar. These  three  sweetend foods differ only  in the process used to make them. Jellies are made  from the juice of a fruit, jams from the thoroughly crushed fruit, and preserves from the  partially  crushed or cut fruit.  They are all equally delicious!

 condiment  [ˈkɑndɪmənt] n.调味料；  cereal [ˈsɪriəl]n.谷物
jelly  [ˈdʒeli]  v.使成为胶质；使冻 果冻
jams [dʒæmz]n.果酱；堵塞；拥   preserve  [prɪˈzɜrv]v.保留；保护；蜜饯
partially  [ˈpɑrʃəli] adv.部分地；

  Berries are also  used  in baked goods. Pies and tarts often  contain  berries as do many other  pastries. These  small  fruits are also  added into  cakes  and  even  breads, especially after drying. In  addition ,  the concentrated juice of berries can be used to  make cool   summer drinks. Concentrated further, various  syrups can be added to foods as diverse as  pancakes and ice cream. As flavorings, they  are often added to candies and chocolates. In Western  cuisine, life  would be less  sweet  and interesting  without  the humble berry.

flavoring  [ˈfleɪvərɪŋ] n.香料；调味 ；  cuisine  [kwɪˈzin] n.烹饪；菜肴

  For  some  people, though, berries   are best  eaten fresh. They  say that  after washing and  refrigerating,   simply place  a  generous  portion of berries into a cereal  bowl, add chilled milk , and top with sugar.  Enjoy ! As the season for berries is  usually in the summer and fall, this  snack  or dessert really hits the spot. For  those  who  do not live where berries grow  naturally and plentifully, these natural  dessert fruits  can be enjoyed while visiting those areas  luck  enough  to have  them.

**  Lesson  28 Tips  on English  Body  Language 

  Mr.Garcia, a businessman from Madrid, Spain, is  speaking English  to one of  his customers, Mr. Patton, from Vancouver, Canada. As  they  speak, a  by-stander notices  that as Mr.Garcia slowly steps closer  to Mr. Patton, the  latter  slowly steps away. This slow  dance  continues  throughout the  conversation  until Mr.Patton is literally  against the wall. He now crosses his arms in front of  him. Mr.Patton appears nervous and a little annoyed; Mr.Garcia,aware of this,  thinks  he is not explaining  himself well enough   in English, even  though Mr. Patton fully  understands  him.  Thinking the business deal has gone sour, Mr, Garcia excuses himself and leaves.

  What is going on  here? If Mr.Garcia or any other  non-native  English  speaking businessman, student, immigrant, or tourist had been aware of English body language, this unfortunate incident could  have been avoided. Among English speakers, personal space  is very  important; indeed, personal  space is important in all languages,  but the distance  considered citical to  trigger discomfort differs, Spanish speakers tolerate a much  closer speaking  distance , a  distance of some 30  centimeters, which is about  half  that which  English speakers prefer. Thus , a Spanish Speaker will instinctively move in  closer  to talk  with  an English  speaker, who  instinctively movers  away, closer  to his   perferred speaking distance.

immigrant [ˈɪmɪɡrənt] n.（外来）移民；外侨 unfortunate [ʌnˈfɔrtʃənət] adj.不幸的；倒霉的
incident [ˈɪnsɪdənt] adj.事变；事故；小事件   avoid [əˈvɔɪd] v.避免；防止

  Body  language is one kind  of nonverbal  communication,  such as  winking (to indicate "I'm  kidding" or a sexual advance),  or arms held akimbo(in some cultures, merely resting; in other,  a threatening or defiant stance). This  communication can ,  on occasion,  be even more important than  the actual words  spoken.

nonverbal [nɑnˈvɜrb(ə)l] adj.非言语的        winking ['wɪŋkɪŋ] n.眨眼
indicate [ˈɪndɪˌkeɪt] v.指示；表明；显示；  sexual [ˈsekʃuəl] dj.性行为的；性的
advance [ədˈvæns] n.进展；进步；提高；暗示  arms [ɑrmz] 英: [ɑː(r)mz] v.“arm”的第三人称单数 手臂；
akimbo [əˈkɪmboʊ] adv.两手叉腰   held [held] v.hold(拥有；握住)的过去式和过去分词
merely [ˈmɪrli] adv.仅仅；只不过  resting ['restɪŋ] adj. 放松 【植】休眠的；静止的；沉默的；【生】静止的
threatening [ˈθret(ə)nɪŋ] adj.威胁的；恐吓的；  defiant [dɪˈfaɪənt] adj.公然违抗的；反抗的；挑衅的
stance [stæns] n.立场 站姿； occasion [əˈkeɪʒ(ə)n] n.时机；理由；原因；
actual [ˈæktʃuəl] adj.真实的；实际的 
  
  Take  winking  for example. In most cases, English   speakers will wink(the closing  of only one eye)  at  each  other  to show that they  are not serious about what they  are saying. They  may   also cross  their middle finger over their index finger to indicate  the same thing. These gestures are extremely important as they  virtually negate what the speaker says.

gesture [ˈdʒestʃər] n.手势；动作   extremely [ɪkˈstrimli] adv.非常；极其；
virtually [ˈvɜrtʃuəli] adv.几乎；实际上；事实上；虚拟   negate [nəˈɡeɪt] v.否定；否认；取消；使无效

   Another  example  is eye  contact , In many American Indian and East Asian cultures, respect is shown  by not looking  directly into the eyes  of a person considered of  a higher socail class than oneself. For  Western Europeans, the opposite is true. For them, anything less than  full eye  contact  is considered disrespectful or even devious. Problems  have arisen  when  Chinese  or Korean school  children enter American or European schools. Western  teachers assume  that these children are "up to  something" or that  they are  showing disrespect, when, in actuality , they are behaving correctly for their own culture. One  chinese child was  denied entry  into a gifted students'  school  because  he was considered "lacking leadership qualities" despite his overall excellence in his academic and interpersonal  relations. When  it was pointed out  that Chinese  children are taught  not  to be  aggressive(show leadership qualities), the  school reconsidered and  admitted the lad.

contact [ˈkɑnˌtækt] n.接触；联络；交往  directly [daɪˈrektli]adv.正；直接地 径直
disrespectful [ˌdɪsrɪˈspektfl] adj.粗俗；不尊敬  devious [ˈdiviəs] adj.不诚实的；不直率的；
arise [əˈraɪz] v.出现；发生；；产生   assume [əˈsum] v.假设；假定 以为 
disrespect [ˌdɪsrɪˈspekt] n.不尊敬；无礼   actuality [ˌæktʃuˈæləti] n.实际；真实；真实情况
correctly [kəˈrɛktlɪ] adv.正确地；实事求是  deny [dɪˈnaɪ] v.否认；拒绝；
gifted [ˈɡɪftəd] adj.有天才的；有天赋的； lack [læk] v.缺乏；没有；不足；短
despite [dɪˈspaɪt] prep.尽管；即使；尽管（   academic [ˌækəˈdemɪk] adj.教学的；学术性的
interpersonal  relations 人际关系   aggressive [əˈɡresɪv]adj.好斗的；挑衅的；侵略的；富于攻击性的
admitted [əd'mɪtɪd] adj.被承认了的；   lad [læd] n.小伙子；少年；男孩儿；男青年 

   Sometimes  gestures used in different  languages have  contrary meanings . This  can produce a  humorous  effect. In  Vietnam and China.  the gesture for "come here " is quite similar to that of waving "good bye"  in English . Thus , when  speakers of these these   two cultures  are leaving each other, if the English speaker gestures "good-bye" the Far Eastern speaker may misinterpret the signal as meaning,"com back here."

gesture [ˈdʒestʃər] n.手势；动作     contrary [ˈkɒntrərɪ] n.相反；反面
wave [weɪv] v.波动；挥；摇；摇摆 挥手  misinterpret  [ˌmɪsɪnˈtɜrprət] v.误解；误释
invitation [ˌɪnvɪˈteɪʃ(ə)n] n.邀请；请柬；  
   
   Learning   body gestures in rather diffcult from textbooks. The best way to learn gestures -- for any language or culture -- is to stay a while in a foreign country to lean not  only  what people say but how they say it . For most people , the learning  of body  language is an exciting and charming aspect of learning a foreign language.  

charming [ˈtʃɑrmɪŋ]  a.迷人的；楚楚动人的；英俊的；潇洒的可爱的；有魅力的；妩媚
aspect [ˈæspekt] n   .方面； 部分 层面；外观；方位

Everyone  knows that  there  are more speakers  of Mandarin  than  other language in the world. Just  over one billion  people speak Mandarin as their native tongue. Compared  to  the nearly for  hundred  million native speakers of English. there would appear to be "no contest"  Yet , it  is just  as well-known that English  ,not Mandarin, is the international language. Given  these  statistics, how can this be ? Looking  more closely  at these and other facts reveals how English has become the world's  most widespread  language.

   The  history of written Chinese goes  back at   least 4 000 years.  that   of English  little more than   1 000 years.  The language  called English  is actually a  hybrid of Scandinavian  and  German  tongues   created by  immigrants  to England   in the 5th century  A.D.  Over  the next  500 years, English developed into several major dialects spoken principally on most of the island of England. With  continuous invasions by  more  Scandinavians and   the French over the  next few centuries,  the English language  received a fresh stimulus  of foreign  words, including Latin and Greek, the preferred classical languages in  educational  and political circles at that  time in Europe. English as a  principal language of literature did  not evolve until the 14th  century(Chaucer).  By   the 16th  century, English was in full bloom, both  in  literature as well  as in science.

   England,  referred to  as  Great  Britain by   this time, was  amassing  political, economic, and military  power  at breath-taking(惊人的) speed.  The Industrial Revolution of  the next century  required foreign  resources;  imperialism  gave the go-ahead  for Britain and  other European powers to not only take  what  they  wanted  from foreign lands  but to  lay  conquest to those lands as well.      Additionally, the rapid  social changes engendered by the change from agriculture to manufacturing meant a surplus of farm workers, resulting in a  waiting army of  the dispossessed  to emigrate to Britain's  newfound colonies. In the  17th and  18th  centuries, millions of Englishmen left their mother  country  for  North America.  In the  18th century,hundreds of thousands more set sail for Australia and New Zealand, as  well as  South Asia(the British Raj)  and Africa(primarily South Africa).  At  the height  of the British Empire, one-fourth of the world's  people  and lands  were living under the Union Jack. Thus, by  the close of the 19th  century English  rule had extended to the six principal continents(including British Guyana in South America.)

  This first-ever domination of the gobe by one language is the primary reason for the  international  use of English  today. A second reason  lies in the rise  of the United States of America  as a  leading world  power  just  as Britain's  power began to fade. At  The  close of  the 19th century, the U.S. fought with Spain(in 1898)   After the U.S. victory, Spain  ceded the Philippines, Guam ,and Puerto Rico .resulting in the further  introduction of English  into Asia  and the Caribbean. After U.S. involvement in both  World Wars, despite Britain's  continued decline, English became  more commonly used  around the world, especially  in continental  Europe and Japan. Since 1950,  the  rapidly growing U.S. economy as  well as  its academic and scientific  excellence has insured that  English  remains the language of commerce  and intellectual intercourse. The world of entertainment,most notably Hollywood, has  also contributed to  the popularization of English .

**  Lesson 29 The  Fundamentals of Public Speaking

  What is the most terrifying experience for most people ? Is it drowning ? Is it  falling from a  high place  to their  death? Is it being  attacked by wild dogs? Though  these  experiences would  certainly frighten most people, according to  recent poll, most people  fear standing  on a stage in front of a group  of people to  deliver a speech  more than  anything  else,  including  the above  life-threatening  scenarios! What  is going  on here? Why  is public  speaking so menacing to most people ?

  Coaches of  public  speaking are fond  of  noting  that   public  speaking "is an unnatural act."   This   is a  tongue-in-cheek  definition.  Though people  usually  think  of kinky sex as an "unnatural act" public speaking is is one important way  unnatural  .Human communication  is inseparable from  the human condition; that is , we actually spend more time in communicating  with  other(including  listening to  prerecorded spoken information)  than   we do anything else  except breathing . There   is , in other words, nothing unnatural in communicating. Standing  on a stage  in front of a group fo people  to deliver a speech, however, is certainly  unnatural. In  no other situation  do so many humans have  to keep quiet, watch the speaker  attentively, and keep their  minds on the message without an  opportunity to respond. In  no other situation can one speaker  command the silence of an entire group fo people. The responsibility   on both sides in taxing; hence, the  very act of speaking in public breaks the natural rules of human discourse and is thus unnatural.


coach [koʊtʃ]    v.教练；辅导      fond [fɑnd]    adj.喜爱

  The result of this  unnatural act is to make both the speaker  and the audience  somewhat nervos in their new roles as dominant speaker  and submisssive  audience. Most people do not understand the mechanics of crowd  control or public speaking and are  terrified by even the notion of appearing alone in front of  what many perceive  as s  hostile  group of people.    Actural, the   adudience should be pitied, not the speaker. Who     wants   to sit through a long,  boring  speech?  Who wants to sit and have to listen, without   the chance  to respond to the speaker?  Accomplished public speakers learn to accept the tension  between  the audience and the stage and  work with it. These savy speakers have  some tips for novice speakers.

  An obvious  suggestion is to be  well prepared. Though  it is not a  good idea  to write  out a speech and memorize it (this  is a recitation, not a speech,), preparing an  outline  of the main  ideas  of the topic  in logical order is. Further, practicing the speech out  loud  will help   the speaker identify  the strong and  weak  parts of the speech.

loud [laʊd] adj.响亮的；大声的     identify [aɪˈdentɪˌfaɪ] v.鉴定；确认；发现

  Another  good idea is to face the audience. The  audience , after all, is the  object  of the endeavor.  By nothing their  expressions, a speaker can   often   monitor  whether  he is speaking loudly enough,  too quickly  or slowly, at too  difficult  a  level, etc.   "Sweeping" the audience  with one's attention -- looking  at all sections  of the audience   at one  time or  another   and regularly -- helps  the audience keep its  attention focused  on the speaker.

regularly [ˈreɡjələrli] adv.经常地；有规律地；定期的；均匀地   

  The most important  of these   suggestions , however,  is simply   to be sincere. The 16th president of the United States, Abraham Licoln, said,"You can  fool  some of the people all of the time. You can fool all of the people some of the time. But  you can't  fool all of the  people  all of the time."      These  profound words are applicable to speakers in public. Since  the  audience  is observing and listening to the speaker closely, it is virtually  impossible for  a speaker to fake sounding confident if the is  not , not is it possible for the speaker to  convince and audience  of  his conviction if the himself is not convinced.

  Following   the simple  tips   listed  above  will  improve a speaker's  performance  in public. Like  any other  skill or art, the more one practices, the better  he is likely to become.  Public   speaking  is not only   for speech contests;  all professional  must present themselves in public  sooner or late. Rather   than   shirking the opportunity    to speak, seize  it and make the most of it the next  time  fortune knocks.

** Lesson 30 New Orleans: Birthplace of Jazz
 Orleans : [ˈɔrliənz] n.奥尔良    jazz [dʒæz] n.爵士乐
 
  Welcome to  Crescent City, birthplace of Jazz!"Crescent City" ? Yes, the nickname  for New Orleans  is Crescent City, due  to its downtown location along a  particularly  deep bend of the   Mississippi River. No matter  what this unique American city is called, New  Orleans has  something for everyone. 

  crescent  [ˈkrez(ə)nt] n.新月形  particularly  [pərˈtɪkjələrli] adv.特别；尤其
bend [bend] v.弯曲；（使）倾斜     unique [juˈnik] adj.唯一的

  To understand why this  southern city is so different  from  any other  city of the United States, and perhaps also how it evolved the musical form Dixieland jazz, it is necessary  to give a  brief  description  of its history.  Founded in 1718 by  French developers, New Orleans grew  rather slowly. Although  ideal for  shipping(New Orleans is only 180 kilometers from   the mouth of the Mississippi, the world's fourth-longest river), the land around New Orleans is extremely low-lying(The city is  actually below sea level!) and was  at that time nothing  more than  a  swamp. Despite this , the city  attracted a  wide range of peoples, including Canadian  and European  French, slaves, American  Indians, and a  few  white British settlers, The area's  continued slow growth, however, convinced France that it should sell  all of its  extensive land holdings in North  America to Spain in 1763. Spain ruled this large area including  New Orleans until 1800, when  the whole area was again returned to French , only to be sold to the United States in 1803. The  early  French and Spanish cultures have remained with city, even  with approach of 200 years of American rule .

  The fortunes of  New  Orleans have always  depended on its riparian location. The city gained importance  in the War  of  1812 and later as the terminus  for shipping   along the Mississippi through  the Civil War.   As shipping declined   in importance  due to   the building  of the railroads near the end of  19th century, however, the Golden Age of New  Orleans  wound down .  At  this time , however, an artistic  creation particular to New Orleans would  resuscitate the  city's fortunes.

   Music has always   played an   important  part  in the daily lives of most Americans, and New Orleans  happend   to be home to some of the best   musicians in the country.  From  1880 to World War I, NEW Orleans with its cafe  and night  club  society  became host(大本营) to a  new form of music based mostly on  the blues, but also on  marches and ragtime music. In this style  of music, the trumpet, clarinet, and trombone form the basis  of instrumentation .  As  the  trumpet is  the loudest, it normally  carries the melody, with the clarinet and  trombone improvising  above  and below the trumpet, respectively. Sidney  Bechet, Buddy Bolden, King   Oliver, and most famously Louis Armstrong became  symbols of the new music , playing to packed houses  at first in the New Orleans  red light district, and  later to  fans  in music   halls all  around the world.

   Though  Dixieland jazz is today  a preserved form of music like classical music, it later spawned Big Band music  popular  until  the end of World War II, and  urban  jazz,  still popular in the United States  as well as  in other  countries, To hear   the   original Dixieland  jazz  one has   only to book a  hotle room in the Vieux Carre  district of  New  Orleans anytime of the year. The  French and Spanish  architecture and laid-back  lifestyle  there is  the perfect place to enjoy the  upbeat but relaxing  sounds of Dixieland jazz. Devotees of jazz  pack  Preservation   Hall, Dixieland Hal, and the night clubs along  Borubon Street  to hear  their  favorite songs. The  New Orleans jazz  Club  stages  many jazz events, as does  the city government, such as the International  Jazz and Heritage Festival.  If  you can  visit New  Orleans only once  in  your life, though, save it  for  the world famous Mardi Gras. You  can  then  enjoy  the best of New  Orleans's night life  with as many as one million   other party  revelers!

** Lesson 31  The Fine Art of Giving

fine art n.【艺】艺术(尤指绘画及雕塑) 美术；艺术；纯美术

  Ralph is  all excited. When  his poor wife Lisa comes home  after a hard day's work in  the office, he enters the living room  beaming. "Happy birthday,darling!"  he exclaims while thrusting  the neatly packed  gift  at her. Momentarily delighted as she  quickly  unwraps the  package, Lisa murmurs,"Oh Ralph, I thought  you'd  forget my birthday again  this year. Gee, thanks, sweet..."  Her  voice trails  off as  she  lifts the cover of  the box  to disclose   its contents: steak knives. Ralph, still beaming, then pulls  the trigger of the rifle aimed at his own foot:" I bought  some steaks , so you can  use your new birthday  gift to get us dinner  ready!"

the rifle aimed at his own foot  自讨没趣  

   Most women, of course, would  use the  new knives on Ralph , not the steaks. What  did  poor  Ralph do  wrong? He certainly  meant well .He noted his wife's birthday carefully, sacrificed time and money  to buy a gift on  time  and even  had  the box  gift-wrapped.  Where did he go wrong? Long  before  Ralph  bought  the knives, he should  have paid more attention  to those   things   Lisa expressed or showed  an interest in.  While walking  or shopping, many people  notice  things  that  obviously interest them; this is  the time to  make a mental note of what  those  items are for future   purchase. While  taking, too, many  people  reveal "wish list"  items they  dream of having. Noting  these  items  and turning them  into gifts at a  later time, whether  for Christmas, birthday, anniversary, graduation, or any other  important  occasion, distinguished  just  another  item  on a shelf  in a department  store or  in a  catalogue   from "the perfect gift"

  Gifts do not have to be objects.  Doing  house  chores for parents or spouses which  normally are "theirs,"  talking  someone out on the  town or wheeling an  invalid around the block,  or taking   the time and effort to create  one's  own  personalized  handicraft can bring smiles as wide as those  aroused by   the giving  of expensive presents. Many  a  child would prefer  to have  an afternoon   at the cinema and an  evening   in their  favorite restaurant with  Dad  than another of  his expensive  gifts, some with  the price tag  still on  them!  Many  parents would  rather  happily  settle for a full day  with their  children at home or on a  picnic than with  a  mailed check or "Happy Birthday"  greeting  on their  answering  machine.  Perhaps  the  expression "Time is money"  really is  true: time  spent with    those  whom we do not often  see is  indeed  precious.  Sacrificing time from one's  busy  schedule  to give to another  is often   more  meaningful than  a pricy gift  from an upscale department store.

   Of  course , there  is nothing  wrong with buying gifts. Everyone has needs , including  material needs. Close  friends  or family members often know what  their  loved ones need even before  they do! Few  compliments can make us  happier than "You always know what to give me" For  those who never seem to know  what  to prepare for  others  but who would  like to  learn, observing the successful  giving   of gifts  to others is as good a  place to start as any.  In any class, family, or crowd , someone always  seems to know  the right   gift  to give at the  right time. Making  mental  notes of these  occasions and then  writing  them  down  in a special notebook  can make the difference  between a future   present well-received and one politely accepted.

   Still, only  a social incompetent would criticize  or refuse a  gift from another. Being gracious even in disappointment is a sign of good manners. Besides, a gift is an  expression of thoughtfulness  and a token  of love. We should never question  the judgment of the donor; instead, as we say in English , "It's the thought that counts." Learning  to appreciate  whatever little  surprises life prepares for us is a  sure sign of maturity and poise. When  the giving of symbols  of our  appreciation and love  the others  becomes an art  form to the giver, these profound words can be understood:"It is more blessed to give than to  receive."

** Lesson 32  Professional Telephone   Etiquette
  "(ring...ring...ring..)"   Hello?
  "Uh, EXCUSe ME, but is this  Dragon Mountain  Trading Company?"
  "Who's  calling?"
  "well, I'm Mr.David Parker, and I ..."
  "What do you want?"
  "I'd, uh, like  to speak with your manager."
  "He's busy, Call back later.(click)"
  Unfortunately, some companies still have  not trained their  employees in the professional  use of  the telephone. The above telephone  conversation  is not only discourteous, but also   hurts  business prospects. If Mr. Parker is calling to speak with a  number of companies in order  to build  business relationships  with them, he  is not very likely to call Dragon  Mountain  Trading Company again. To  prevent this  from happening , those   who are responsible  for the conduct of business over the telphone   should keep a few    simple but important points of telephone etiquette in mind. 

trained [treɪnd] v.“train”的过去分词和过去式 训练；培训；    
employee [ˌɪmplɔɪˈi] n.雇员    trading [ˈtreɪdɪŋ] n.交易；贸易 
discourteous [dɪsˈkɜrtiəs] adj.不礼貌的；失礼   prospects [prəˈspekt] n.展望；前途
prevent [prɪˈvent] v.阻止；阻碍   responsible [rɪˈspɑnsəb(ə)l] adj.负责；有责任；承担义务；应受责备 负责的；
conduct [ˈkɑnˌdʌkt] v. 使用 实施；执行   etiquette [ˈetɪˌket] n.礼仪

  The first and most important  point  concerning   the professional use of  the telephone is the attitude  towards  any caller. The telephone  is the lifeline of the company with the outside world, and those who call in  should be considered potential business prospects. However customers are  not nameless, faceless voices; they  are people  who enjoy  being  and deserve to be treated courteously and fairly. Everyone who  uses  an office telephone  should  remember  that a  friendly, helpful, and efficient call can  make the difference  between success  and failure  with  the caller. Once  this is appreciated, a  business office can operate at its  full  potential.

concerning [kənˈsɜrnɪŋ] prep.关于；涉及 v.“concern”的现在分词
attitude [ˈætɪˌtud] n.态度；看法  potential [pəˈtenʃ(ə)l] n.潜力；；可能性 adj.潜在的；

deserve [dɪˈzɜrv] v.值得；应得；应受    courteously [ˈkɜrtiəslɪ] adv.毕恭毕敬地 有礼貌地
fairly [ˈferli] adv.公正地；相当地   efficient [ɪˈfɪʃ(ə)nt] adj.效率高的；有功效的
appreciate [əˈpriʃiˌeɪt] v. 意识 感激；欣赏；意识到；  potential [pəˈtenʃ(ə)l] n.潜力

   How can all office workers put the above principle  into practice? Several tips on the successful use of the office telephone  have  been collected from  many companies over  the years. This  advice is timeless and  covers all manner  of businesses. Companies  whose   employees use the following   telephone   etiquette are more likely to keep  their  clients  and   attract new customers.

principle [ˈprɪnsəp(ə)l] n.原理；原则；工作原理；法则 主义；信条；准则
attract [əˈtrækt] v.吸引；招引    advice [ədˈvaɪs] n.建议；意见

all manner of na.各色各样的(人,东西等等)各种各样的
time test  un.时间考验的 耐入性试验；耐久性试验

   When  answering the  phone ,  all employees   should  identify  the company  and themselves. In  the above  hypothetical   conversation, the office   worker  should  have answered  the call with , "Dragon Trading  Company, Janice Wang, speaking." rather  than force Mr.Parker to inquire whether   or not he had dialed   the company telephone number correctly.  In some companies, employees  will further identify their position within   the company, such   as "Kodak, MIchael Chou, sales representative,speaking" or " Great Light Sport  Equipment,Frances Chang ,   personnel director, speaking. May I  help you?"  and so on.  Of course , in larger  companies which have automated dialing or  an operator, it is  often   unnecessary   to state the name of   the company(that has been done already on the tape or by the operator), bu self-identification  continues to be helpful, and ,thus , important.

  As with  Frances Chang above,  a  simple "May I help you?" is enough  to invite the caller  to  state his or her business with  the company.  However,  It is   always important  to listen carefully to the caller's  request.  It is possible , for example , that the  callee is not the right  person for whom the caller is looking; by  listening carefully , the callee can respond to the needs  of the customer on the  line. Treating callers as routine or even  annoying interruptions to one's  work  is a mistake. If someone outside  the company has  taken  the time to call in, someone inside the company should take the time to respond to it.

callee[kɔld] 受访问者；电话接话人   routine [ˌruˈtin] n.常规；例程；adj.常规的；例行公事的；日常的；平常的
annoying [əˈnɔɪɪŋ] adj.使恼怒的；使生气的；使烦恼的
interruption [ˌɪntəˈrʌpʃən]     n.中断；打断；打岔；停止    网络干扰；中断数；插话
  

   If the caller is looking for someone  not presently in the office, a message should be taken and then repeated over   the phone  to make sure all the information is correct. If a  product or service is unavailable, the caller should  be told what possible substitute  is available or when the desired item  will be back in stock.  Every  effort  should  be made to please  the caller. This   extra effort makers a lasting impression, the  kind of impression  that often  results in repeat business. In   our  conversation above, the callee  should have told  Mr. Parker  when     the manager would  return  to  take his call, or offered to take a   message for him. Hanging  up on the caller is the best  way to lose  business.

  Today's world of business is highly competitive. People have not cahanged, however. They still  like to be treated in a friendly and helpful way, even  over the telephone. A genuinely  friendly and helpful attitude on the phone, identification  of company and callee, offers of help or message taking,  promotion  of further  business opportunities, and leaving  the caller with the feeling that he would like to call again seem like  insignificant  matters. Added up , however , the can  make the difference between  a company's  success   and failure in our  high-tech but still  human world.

     After  information has been given or help offered, the call  should not be considered finished. Each call is an opportunity    to further  the interests  of the company, as wiht "We have other fine  products. I'd be hapy to send you  our cataloogue."  or "Our  company can offer additional  services. My manager or I would  be happy   to make an appointment with you to discuss them."
Above all, end each  conversation  with a genuine "Thank  you for  calling. It's  been a pleasure serving you." or other lines to make  the customer feel he or she is not being discarded as just   another business obligation. Successful calls make customers   feel welcome to call again.

** Lesson 33  Did You Remember Your Tickets?
counter [ˈkaʊntər] n.计算器；（商店、银行等的）柜台；  

  Robert and Michael  leave  their  apartment in a rush  and find a  taxi  to take  them to the airport.  After   paying  the drive, Robert turns to Michael and says, "That  was close! I though wd'd  be late for sure. Come on , now , we have to take our luggage  into the terminal and check in at the counter." "Right," responds Michael, "did you  bring the tickets and out passport?"  "No,"  answers Robert, "I thought you did!"

  This  scene could be from  a TV sitcom or real-life. Every  traveler's nightmare is forgetting something  major like tickets, ID,passport, or money. This  is needless worry,however,if travel plans are made early and organized  efficiently. Since  travel for education, business, or pleasure is more and more common, knowing how to prepare for worry-free travel is  both important  and beneficial. This  lesson will help the novice or  experienced traveler avoid potential travel problems, allowing  for a pleasant  journey.

  Unless there is  an emergency, travel plans should be made well  in advance.  Never  wait  till the last minute  to try  to reserve airline tickets or hotel rooms. They may not  be available, or you may  be forced to choose an inconvenient or unnecessarily expensive flight or accommodation. The best day to book travel or lodging arrangements is the day you decide to go.

arrangement [əˈreɪndʒmənt]n.安排；布置；整理 

“学如逆水行舟，不进则退”的英语翻译是： Learning is like sailing against the current； if you don't advance, you will retreat.

  After  all travel arrangements have been secured , the next  step is to make sure your travel documents are in order. Is your passport valid? Remember  that  some countries do not  accept passprots which   have less than six  months' validity  remaining. Do you need an overseas driver's license? These  can be applied for at certain government or travel agencies  or  associations. Leave enough  time  to process any paperwork that is required. A travel agent or experienced friend or colleague can inform you of what steps need  to be taken and how best to take care of them.

  Preparing for packing is next. Even if the proposed trip  is a month away, certain items shoud be readied at once. The  most important of these is , of course, the luggage itself. Do not wait for a last-minute sale on the suitcase of your choice;  be ready with enough   good-quality luggage long befor you leave for  the airport or train station. In choosing baggage, make sure  that it is within regulations, especaally for air travel. Oversize  suitcases or carry-on baggage  can be a great headache later.

  The rule of thumb of packing is pack less, not more. Most  travelers buy at least some items on the road , and some buy quite a few souvenirs or personal items, so leave enough  room  for them. Keeping  a toiletry kit permanently in a piece of luggage is a smart idea. In this way , you will never have to worry about  whether your razor or deodorant has  been packed. Casual clothing, including footwear, shoud be placed into bags  or suitcases the night  before. Formal wear can be packed in the last-minute to reduce wrinkling. Don't worry about taking reading or writing material for pleasure; newspapers and  magazines are widely available, as it stationery.

  The day before leaving, reserve a cab for the day of departure if needed. This  is also the best time to ask a friend or relative for a wake-up  call for those leaving earlyh on  the day of departure; this is even better than one's  own alarm clock.  Leave a copy of the itinerary with lodging telephone numbers with a familyh or friend. Place all travel documents into one  briefcase or folder rather than in several places for ease of checking. After packing each piece of luggage, put it  near the door for easy exit These  simple advance steps will help reduce  stress on the day of travel.

  On the day of departure, the only steps remaining  should  be to packe one's  formal clothing and to recheck one's travel  documents and money. Whether for business, education, or  pleasure, travel can be an unforgettable experience, Whether you want to remember that experience fondly or try ot forget it depends on  the few simple steps outlined above. Bon voyage!

** Lesson 34  English  Small Talk Topics: What is OK and  What Is Not?

    "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." What may be perfectly acceptable to talk about in one culture may offend  or even shock others when in a  different culture. Accordingly,  it is important to know what topics are "safe" to  discuss with strangers or acquaintances from a different background.  Topics which can be discussed freely within a culture  are referred  to as "small talk."

small talk n.闲谈；聊天             topic [ˈtɑpɪk] n.话题；论题；标题；原理
offend [əˈfend] v.冒犯；得罪 触怒   shock [ʃɑk] n. 吓着  震惊
acquaintance [əˈkweɪntəns] n.熟人；相识 认识的人  refer to v.查阅；提到 把某人叫作；

    As   with any other language, English  has its own stock of non-offensive topics. Among these are the weather, occupation,immediate conditions, family and family life, and school or work. Topics in English which should never be broached include one's personal life, physical appearance(unless complimentary), income, and age as well as religious,  sexual,or political views, Each  of these topics -- both approved  and   taboo -- will be discussed in more detail later .

stock [stɒk]n.股票；库存；储备v.库存；储备    adj.老一套的；常备的
offensive [əˈfensɪv] n.侵犯 a.冒犯的 occupation [ˌɑkjəˈpeɪʃ(ə)n] n.职业工作
immediate [ɪˈmidiət] adj.立即的；立刻的  condition [kənˈdɪʃ(ə)n] n.条件；情况
broach: [broʊtʃ] 提及      physical [ˈfɪzɪk(ə)l] adj.身体的 物理的；物质
appearance [əˈpɪrəns] n.外观；外表；外貌   complimentary  [ˌkɑmplɪˈment(ə)ri]赞美的
religious [rəˈlɪdʒəs] adj.宗教信仰的；宗教的  sexual  [ˈsekʃuəl] adj.性观念 性别的
political [pəˈlɪtɪk(ə)l] adj.政治的；政府的   approved [əˈpruvd] adj.已被承认的；良好的；
taboo [təˈbu] n.戒律；禁忌  


    Small talk is extremely useful when firest meeting others. Actually, one purpose of small talk is not to find out the   answers to questions  like "How are you?" or  "Nice day, isn't it?" but rather to gauge whether the person is the sort  whom  one would like  to know better. While talking about essentially unimportant  matters such as the  weather, life in the office, or how many children -- if any --one has , each speaker has   the opportunity to determine whether the other is cooperative,  interesting, potentially  useful or friendly, etc. If  a person answers the inquiry about the weather with a grunt or "I hate sunny days,"  no further energy  need be wasted!

extremely [ɪkˈstrimli] adv.非常；极其      gauge [ɡeɪdʒ] n.标准；测量仪器（或仪表） v.估计；判定
sort [sɔrt] n.排序；分类；种类；类别  opportunity [ˌɑpərˈtunəti] n.机会；时机
determine [dɪˈtɜrmɪn] v.确定；决定；   cooperative [koʊˈɑp(ə)rətɪv] adj.合作的；协作的；
potentially [pəˈtenʃəli] adv.潜在地  inquiry [ˈɪŋkwəri] n.调查；询问；
grunt [ɡrʌnt] v.咕哝；呼噜声
further [ˈfɜrðər] adv.进一步；此外   
future [ˈfjutʃər] n.未来
    
    Another  purpose of small talk , once a speaker  is satisfied  that the other person is worth talking  with, is to  explore  possible areas of interest or cooperation. By tactfully going  through "safe topics," some information  may be revealed  which  leads the speaker(s) into a  deeper discussion, especially when  a topic  is a shared hobby or interest. Talking about  the weather  may reveal that one speaker enjoys recreation like camping or hiking. Shooting the breeze  about one's family may   disclose  similar   shared family hobbies like board or card games or barbecues  and picnics. In other  words, small talk may serve as probing of the other person's  personality  and lifestyle.

satisfied [ˈsætɪsˌfaɪd] adj.满意的；满足   tactfully  ['tæktfəlɪ]adv.巧妙地；委婉地
reveal [rɪˈvil] v.透露；揭露；启示         discussion [dɪˈskʌʃ(ə)n] n.讨论；论
recreation [ˌrekriˈeɪʃ(ə)n] n.娱乐；消遣；    barbecue [ˈbɑrbəˌkju] BBQ n.(猪,牛等的)烧烤全牲
breeze [briz] n.微风；和风    Shooting the breeze  闲聊
disclose [dɪsˈkloʊz] v.透露；泄露  similar [ˈsɪmɪlər] adj.类似的；相像  
board [bɔrd] n. 下棋 板；（尤指）木板 v.上船   probe [proʊb] n.探究 

    
    "Everybody complains about the weather, but nobody ever does anything about it,"  so goes  an old saying. Perhaps the safest  of all small talk  topics is the weather. Whether good or bad, a comment about  the temperature or sky condition(sunny  day, cloudy day, rainy day, etc.)  never offends. Commenting on the crowded  traffic or the late  bus, or high prices in the department store (immediate conditions) is also always  appropriate. Similarly, most people do not mind talking  about their work, family , or  school life, either, since for  most people  these are experiences held in common. Even so, asking  whether someone is married or not crosses over into personal  information and therefore should be avoided. If  the speaker happens to mention that he or she has children or is married, however, it is all right to pursue the topic. 

complain [kəmˈpleɪn] v.抱怨；发牢   comment [ˈkɑˌment]  n.评论；批评；议论
temperature [ˈtemp(ə)rəˌtʃʊr] n.温度；气温     condition [kənˈdɪʃ(ə)n] n.条件；状态；状况；情况；环境
offend [əˈfend] v.冒犯；      immediate [ɪˈmidiət] adj.立即的；立刻的；目前的
appropriate [əˈproʊpriˌeɪt] adj.恰当的     avoid [əˈvɔɪd] v.避免；
pursue [pərˈsu] v.追求；追逐；追赶；跟踪 继续   
    
      Asking  such  questions as "How much do you weight?" "How old are you?" or "How much do you earn?"  are taboo in English, at least as starters for conversation. Only  when  friends are close  would they  ask such questions  of each other. Likewise,  for most people, religious or political convictions or sexual  mores are considered  private matters. These   should  not be discussed until  one speaker offers his opinion first. It is not necessary , though,  to respond in kind , The  other speaker can change the subject  to show  that this is a taboo subject.

taboo [təˈbu] n.避讳；禁忌   religious [rəˈlɪdʒəs] adj.宗教信仰的；宗教的；
conviction [kənˈvɪkʃ(ə)n] 信念；立场   opinion [əˈpɪnjən]  n.意见；看法

      Foreigners are usually "forgiven"  the "indiscretion"  of  asking others  offending questions.  Still, it in not a  good idea  to wear out one's  welcome. When a subject has  been turned  down, only a tactless person would pursue it, Being sensitive  to other's  feelings and sense of privacy will win more friends  and influence more people  than  a reckless line of questioning.  When  curiosity seems to be getting the upper hand , remember  that "Silence is golden."

** Lesson 35 Hot Animals Around the World: The Panda
   thirty-fifth   Aug 25 21:30 -

       Some  countries have  adopted  an animal as a  kind  of national mascot. The bald eagle is often  thought of as representing the United  States, for  example . New Zealanders  proudly display  their  kiwi, a native  flightless bird. Australians   cannot  seem to make  up their  minds whether the koala  or the  kangaroo should   represent them. China also  has  two animals  which  often  stand  out in everyone's  mind: the dragon and the giant panda. As the dragon is  a mythological animal, that leaves the giant panda as the only real animal  representative  of China.

 Although  dragons have been associated with China for  thousands of  years, the panda's  inclusion into the Chinese  psyche is far more  recent. The giant  panda was not even  discovered until 1869; it was  already a rare animal at that time , living   in the  high bamboo forests of Sichuan  province  and neighboring parts of Tibet.  Its  more plentiful cousin, the lesser panda, is also referred to as the cat bear or bear cat; however, zoologically speaking , it is neither. The  lesser panda  is a member of  raccoon family, whereas  the giant panda's  classification  is still   dilemma: some authorities consider  it a  member   of the bear family while  others  maintain that  it belong  to the raccoon family, too

 The giant panda is well named.  Reaching a length of 1.5 meters and 160 kilograms, this  gentle omnivore is among the largest land animals of China.  Subsisting  on a diet  of bamboo  and other plants and even  small animals , it can  consume as much as 30 kilograms of food a day.  Now that's  a giant appetite!  Its  distinctive markings -- broad,  white  bands of fur alternating  with black , and small  black circles arond the eyes -- have  endeared the  giant  panda  to animal  lovers everywhere.

  People may want  to hug this huge "teddy bear" but giant  pandas prefer  to live a  solitary life.  This  may account  for their  scarcity;  these   pandas are on all  official  lists of endangered  animals. Estimates of the wild panda population  are difficult  due to  the rugged  terrain they  live in, but most experts agree  that  fewer  than 1000  remain  free. As they birth to only one or two  cubs when mating is successful , the giant  panda's  survival in the wild  is anything  but a foregone conclusion.  The  Chinese  government  has set  aside 11 nature preserves  where  pandas  are know  to exist,  hoping to protect them from  the rapid encroachment of man.  Though  poaching is still a problem, strict  laws   have reduced this senseless carnage.

   Pandas in captivity  number(v)  less than  100, the largest  share, of course  , in China. Those  in Western zoos are treated  as royalty and are the object of intense scientific interest and care. Recently, veterinarians have given male giant pandas  Viagra, hoping  to increase the  animals'  reproductive efficiency. Results  are thus far inconclusive. Though births have been reported, they  are few  and far between. It seems  the  panda's  chance of survival is razor-thin.

   Its extinction would be a sad day for all mankind. These  playful and gentle creatures   never fail  to amuse adults  and children alike  lucky enough  to observe  them  in zoos. Every  plant and animal  that leaves the world due to human  intervention and encroachment of habitat diminishes the world  we live in. The  richness of the Earth's  original biodiversity  is being attacked. Will  future generations  of humanity be left with only a few  species of food plants,  and zoos exhibiting  cockroaches and rats?

** Lesson 36  Vancouver: Asia's   Newest city

 [vænˈkuːvə(r)
  What ?  Wait a  minute! Did I read that right? I thought   Vancouver was  in Canada,  not   in Asia.  Why  is the title of this  article "Vancouver: Asia's  Newest City" ?
  Relax, everyone.  Yes ,Vancouver is still in Canada, North America's largest country, not in Asia. Over the past  twenty years, however, Asians from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, the Philippines, and other  countries across the ocean have flocked into this  largest city on Canada's  Pacific coast. By some accounts, as many as 30% of  households in Vancouver speak Mandarin  or Cantonese, making  the Chinese  there   the largest minority by far.  Just  what  is the attraction of   this  English-speaking city, however?

  A visit to  Vancouver quickly reveals her  charms. Situated on the ocean and possessing a fine, deep-water port, British Columbia's largest city faces Vancouver Island  to the west  and mountains to the east and north. Most of the city is relatively new,having been rebuilt after  a great fire in 1886.(here)The   completion of the Panama Canal in 1915 during  World War I helped spur growth all along the West  Coast of North America, as products from  the western  states  of the United States and  the western provinces of Canada could be profitably shipped to Europe. By  the  1930s Vancouver  had become  Canada's  third-largest city, a position it maintains today. Lumber from  the extensive forested areas within  the province, minerals, seafood, and assorted industries, including  tourism,give the million-plus  residents of  metropolitan Vancouver  a  high  standard of living.

   The  city itself  is comfortable  and  attractive. A large central park called Stanley Park  includes a  zoo,  gardens, arboretum, and aquarium! The  University  of  British Columbia and Simon Fraser University  are located in the greater Vancouver area,  as are many small  and quaint farming and fishing villages within  a  few  hours' drive.  Scenic, unpolluted, and prosperous:  who  could ask for anything more ?

  Certainly not  the Chinese.  Although limited immigration  from the Far East began as early as the 19th century, it was not until  the 1970s  that  immigration to both Canada and the United States began  to increase significantly. By the  1980s, the steady stream had become a flood. Today,  Vancouver's  Chinatown is said to be North America's  second largest. Given  the large  numbers of Chinese living in the much larger cities  of New  York, Toronto, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, that   represents astronomical  growth.

  Vancouver's  Chinatown is located  within walking distance  of the downtown area, as are most  Chinatowns in North America. Here one  can find both traditional  Chinese herbal stores and fresh food markets as well as small retail and service businesses. From mid-May to September, Friday  to Sunday evenings from 6:30 to 11:30, both  Chinese  and "foreign" visitors to this area might mistake themselves as  begin in Shanghai or Hong Kong. For  daytime visitors, the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Gardents is must, offering  beautifully landscaped  floral gardens. The  nearby Chinese  Cultural Center conducts walking  tours of the historic district and even a   slide show  revealing the historic  development of the  area.

district  [ˈdɪstrɪkt] n.区；地区；  revealing   [rɪˈviːlɪŋ] adj.透露真情的
  
  Of course,Vancouver has much more  to offer its residents and out-of-town and overseas visitors, Though -- or  perhaps  because -- it lacks the manic energy of East Coast cities of North America or those of modern Asia, Vancouver continues  to attract new residents with its serenne, safe, and , well, sane lifestyle.

**  Lesson 37   The Germanic Languages
   Most people have heard  of the Tower  of Babel   story in the Bible.  According to  this story, long ago all  people  spoke  the same  language.  Later, however, they  were  punished by  speaking a  great  number of different  tongues. Today , there  are literally thousands of   different languages(defined as mutually  unintelligible tongues)  around the world, though  many   are related to  one another.  Indeed, the two  largest language  families, the Indo-European(the language family with the  largest number of speakers)  and  Sino-Tibetan(containing the Chinese languages, Thai, Vietnamese, and TIbetan)  include  hundreds  of languages with over  half the world's  population.
   
 [dʒərˈmænɪk] adj.德国的；德国人的；日耳曼语（族）的 n.日耳曼语(系
bible  [ˈbaɪb(ə)l]n.《圣经》  literally   [ˈlɪt(ə)rəli] adv.字面上；确实地

  Because  there  are so many languages within the above  two   super-categories of language families, linguists have further divided these linguistically rich and geographically  diverse families into sub-groups,  one of  which , the Germanic  language  group , has the second-largest number of speakers(Chinese being first). Within this  group of over 500,000,000 speakers is the world's foremost international language,   English, foremost in  terms of  its geographic spread and  number  of second-language users. German, spoken  by just over 100,000,000 people, is one of the world's  ten-largest  languages  in  terms of population . As  English  and German  speakers constitute the majorities in several  of the world's  most economically, militarily, and technologically developed  countries, it is important   to be familiar with this  particular language grouping.

Take for example the two largest languages with this  group, English and German.  The word  Haus in German is  house   in  English , with nearly the same pronunciation. Some  names  of German family members are instantly   recognizable to  English  mother, brothe, and uncle (all German nouns are capitalized in print). Other  German family members are easily learned:  Vater, Schwester, and Tante for  the English  father, sister, and aunt. Thus, those who know Englihs and want to study German find  their  first year  of learning vocabulary to be  relatively easy. The  same is true, of course,  for those  who want  to learn Dutch  or Danish from an  English  or German background; these  many similarities are due  to the  single   common parent  language of all the  the  Germanic tongues, even though this "grandfather"    language no longer exists.

noun  [naʊn] n.【语】名词；名词代

  Speakers and writers of the Germanic languages account  for  a great  deal of the world's output  in everything from economics to literature to  military to science and technology. Hardly an  aspect of modern life does not benefit from the contributions made by those using these languages, as  in  the Internet, Hollywood entertainment, Dutch(Phillips) and  Scandinavian  consumer goods  design(Ericsson,maker  of cellular  phones,is a  Swedish company, as are Volvo and Saab) ,  and even  the Noble prizes(awarded by  both Norwegian and Swedish institutes). More than  one-third of the world's  economic production originates in these  countries,[O] too.

literature  [ˈlɪt(ə)rəˌtʃʊr]  n.文学；文学作品；资料     网络文献；文艺；著作
benefit  [ˈbenəfɪt] n.益处；优势；成效   


  For any  speaker of a language outside the Germanic language group  preparing to  choose a useful second language for the future, English  is probably the best bet. German, too,  is very  useful  in the fields of medicine, economics, military, and science and technology.  Being able  to communicate with  others in this  far-reaching linguistic group  will  offer the user immeasurable benefits.

  bet  [bet] n.打赌；赌注；预计；估计 the best bet 喜从天降；最好的选择
far-reaching  [ˌfɑr ˈritʃɪŋ] adj.影响深远的；广泛  immeasurable 美 [ɪˈmeʒərəb(ə)l]  adj.不可估量的；无限的
  benefit [ˈbenəfɪt]     n.益处；优势  linguistic group  语言族群
field  [fild] n.田野；田地；油田；  方面 

感觉到这个时候可以很多可以看得明白了 

**    Lesson 38   Learning How  to  Apologize
  What are the  hardest words  to pronounce in English?  It seems  that "I'm sorry"  are  the two  most difficult words  for  most people  to say.  Perhaps  this difficulty  lies  in the so-called "losing  of face"; when a  person   apologize, he lowers  himself  before  another. Yet  no one is  perfect;everyone makes mistakes.  After  making  a mistake, people should apologize  to set things   straight with  others.
  
apologize  [əˈpɒləˌdʒaɪz]  v.道歉；表示歉  pronounce  [prəˈnaʊns]v.发音；读（音）；
straight [streɪt]  adj.直的；直筒型（非紧身）的；准的；正

  Two  phrases in English  often  confuse  no-native users of this  languages. These  phrases are "I'm sorry"  and "Excuse me."  The latter is used to  ask for information, as  in "Excuse me,(but) do you have the time?"  or "Excuse me,(but) can you  tell me  whether there is a post  office near hear?" "Excuse me " is also used when   it is  necessary to disturb other,  as  when  one person interrupts  two others  speaking: "Excuse me for interrupting,(but) I have  to  leave now.  Another example of  the proper usage of this phrase is when, as s  stranger, you want to point something  out of  benefit  to  someone, as  in "Excuse me,(but) I believe  you dropped something  out of your wallet."  Another  common  instance of  using "Excuse me"  is  in  crowded elevators, stores, or lines when a  person needs to get through  or get out, "Excuse me,(but) this is my floor" is a very handy phrase to learn when in crowded elevators, In all these  cases, "Pardon me" may also  be used; however, it is  more often used  in British than in America  English .
  
  phrase  [freɪz]  n.成语；用语；习惯  perhaps 可能 
disturb  [dɪˈstɜrb] v.打扰；干扰；   interrupt [ˌɪntəˈrʌpt] v.中断；打扰
proper [ˈprɑpər]     adv.非常；好好地；完完全全地；彻底地     adj.正确的；恰当
benefit  [ˈbenəfɪt]     n.益处；优势；成效；福利费（政府对失业者、病人等提供的补助金）
floor  [flɔr] n.地板；地面；楼层  handy  [ˈhændi]adj.便利；手巧；易使用的；容易做的     网络方便的；手边的；便利的
 complain  except 

   When  is "I'm sorry"  used?   For more serious incidents.  Stepping on someone's  toes on  a crowded bus, though not intentional, should elicit an  immediate "I'm sorry."  Bumping  into someone even on a crowded street where it is  difficult  not to also  calls for "I'm sorry."  Careless or late work in school or in the office requires out  apology to teachers, colleagues, or employers. Being late for meetings or dates needs both  an apology and often  either  a reason for the  tardiness or  an  explanation  of what   course of action will  be taken  to eliminate  any future  possibility    of recurrence.  No  one   likes to be  wronged, intentionally or otherwise. Saying "I'm  sorry" can go a  long way  towards rectifying  an awkward situation.

   Even  more  importantly, saying "I'm sorry"  is  necessary  when  intentional  harm has  been done. The  borrowing of an item  without first  informing the owner -- who  later  discovers  the "theft" - can be quite embarrassing. A  simple  but sincere "I'm sorry" might repair the damage done. Careless comments  or  insults which
   offend others may  be ameliorated with that simple phrase, though sincerity in voice and gesture make all the difference. Similarly, young  lovers, often exasperated in  unrequited love, may purposefully hurt each other, only later  to profoundly regret what they  had done.  At  these times, a  heartfelt "I'm sorry"  may redress the pain of the on inflicted by   love's arrows. Even better, "Please forgive me" may be used, as it is considered a stronger  expression of remorse.

    Learning  to apologize  in another language does not excuse speakers from practicing the same good  manners in  their mother tongue.  So many people  lament the coldness  of  modern society; human relationships  have  been worn thin from  constant urban  pressures. Part of this  problem seems to  be that people  no longer use such simple words as "please," " thank you,"   and "I'm sorry."  They  cost nothing, but can  bring a wealth  of pleasure or relief to those who  hear them. They require little  effort, yet these few syllables  can enliven  someone   else's day. So, why not use them whenever possible?
