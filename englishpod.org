* 18 Protest
A:This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O’Connell reporting live from Washington, D. C. where a protest has broken out. Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry! Sir, sir, Sarah O’Connell, Action 5 news. Can you tell us what’s happening?
B:Yeah, yeah, we’re here because we feel this is an injustice! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We’re there to show the government that we don’t like the way that they’re spending our tax dollars!
A: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry?
B:It’s an absolute outrage, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.
A:I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.
B:That maybe true, and I for one don’t want to see anyone lose their job, but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they’re making millions of dollars? And then, they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars! And they’re asking for money! That is just not right!

B: Uh well...would you like the bad news first or the  really bad news?
A: What? Ed, don’t tell me you only have bad news!
B:Well sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty  percent in the past month alone. We are currently  overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It’s a real mess.

B:Oh, that’s the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty. We’re going to  have to recall all items sold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We’re  going to have to shoulder this cost.
A: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now!  They have to assume the costs of this mess!

B:Baby, come on. Don’t do this to me! Whatever  it is, we can work it out. Just give me another  chance! I know that we can get through this, but  we gotta stick together! Don’t leave me.

A: I see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that’s why it won’t flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that’s not working either. I suspect that there’s some sort of foreign object in  the pipes that’s causing a blockage. That’s what’s  making your toilet overflow.
B: Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the  toilet. You know how kids are.
A: Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. That could be causing water to not  drain completely; that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn’t shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it’s urgent.

* B135 Cheer up

A: Ok... I’ll talk to you later. Bye
B: Carrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down.
A: I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It’s so hard to talk to him at times.
B: Maybe it’s just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve  wracking job you know.
A:Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what’s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.
B:Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.
A:I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn’t always this grouchy you know...
B:Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn’t work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!
A:You are something else you know that? ==I can’tbelieve you

*  137 Getting  Internet Service
A:Welcome to Galanet. How can I help you?
B:Hi. I would like to get an internet plan for my  house.
A:Of course. We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from. The first one  is the cheapest but most  basic plan which is thirty dollars a month. This is for broadband internet  with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps.
B:I have no idea what kbps means. I just want to be able to get online, play games and chat with my  friends. Oh, and watch movies online as well.
A:Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for  your needs. I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month  which includes a connection speed of two megabytes. That way you can play games online without any lag. This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free!
B:Do I have to pay an installation fee? 
A:Lucky for you, this month we aren’t charging our normal installation fee. You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there! And we’ll throw in this pen drive!

Daddy: Bobby! Come here, look what I got you!
Bobby: What is that?
Daddy: A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play!
Bobby: Cool!
Daddy: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I’ll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.
Bobby:  What about all these other pieces?
Daddy: See this one that looks like a tower? It’s called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it’s a very important  piece so it’s best to not let your opponent capture it.
Bobby: And these two? They are husband and   wife?
Daddy: That’s right! That’s the queen and that’s the king. If the other player captures your king,
he will say ”Check Mate” and the game is  over! Doesn’t this sound fun? 
Bobby: Nah! This is boring! I’m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation!

A:Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings  time?
B: What? Why do we have to do that?
A:Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the  afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In  any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.
B:I see. That’s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!
A:That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here  in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones east of Greenwich!

B:  That’s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing  to LA! Because of the huge time difference, even  though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It’s like we went back in time!

#主持人文本 
Welcome back to English pot. My name is Marco, my name is Catherine and today we're talking about buying clothes. That's right, we're gonna go and get some clothes. But on this occasion we're going to get a suit and we're gonna have it made especially for us. So before we get started, why don't we take a look at one keyword that we have in vocabulary preview.Vocabulary preview.Okay, this word makes me think of things that are very rich and soft.It's a fabric, right? That's right. It's a kind of textiles called cashmere cashmere. So maybe you've heard of cashmere wall, special kind of will. It comes from animals. Ah, so this is A A textile or fabric that is commonly used to make pants, a nice pants or suits for men or scarves or sweaters. You never had a cashmere sweater. You know it's very luxurious, very soft, so it can be a little bit expensive depending on the quality and that's what we're gonna be looking at now. We're gonna be, we're gonna be making a suit out of cashmere. So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time.

luxurious[lʌɡˈʒʊriəs] adj. 奢侈的，豪华的；心满意足的，舒适的；辞藻华丽的

Me of something that people used to do a lot more often. So you go to the tailor, you have some clothes made. Most people don't do this anymore. Yeah, well, it's actually really interesting. Maybe because it's more expensive nowadays or tailors are harder to find. That's right. So let's learn about the words first and what they mean. And then maybe we can talk about this at the end of today's show.Language take away. Alright, so today on language takeaway we have a word that is a noun and a verb. So as you mentioned, the person that makes suits is a tailor. That's right, you can say my uncle is a tailor. He makes clothes for famous people but this word is also a verb. That means it's an action word. We can say my uncle the tailor, he tailors clothes. Okay, so to tailor clothes and what does it mean when you say to Taylor well can have two meanings? The first is what we learn about in today's dialogue it means to make.Make clothes, so to make a shirt or to make a pair of pants. But these days we often say Taylor, which means to.Fix something. So, for example, Marco, if you buy a pair of pants.And they're too long right? You can have them tailored have been tailored and that means that I am going to have them fixed so they fit me properly exactly. This is a lot more common right now. Okay? So we're gonna be tailoring close. Now, if any of you have ever been to the tailor what they do is they measure you and what do they measure? Well in this case they get the width of your shoulders. What's really great about these upcoming words is that they're useful in math as well math and basic measurements. So what is how a big something is across cross? How wide something is exactly why with okay. So that's the width. Now your shoulders they are wide and well your legs on the other hand

Your shoulders. They are wide and, well, your legs. On the other hand, your legs and arms, you don't measure the width usually measure.You measure that link, how long they are okay.So with and length, now just throw it in there. This wasn't in the dialogue but won't be the other measure word. So the third word would be height. So you think of a rectangle. Ah, you have the width. How wide? Something is the length, how long it is in the height, how tall? Tall, right?So with length and height, alright, now that we've measured our arms and legs, now we want to measure our waist.Okay, this is the important one, this is also the sensitive.One, if you find that you gained some weight, we measure the waste. Okay, that's how big you are around your stomach. And so usually we measure this in a circle. Okay, okay so you've heard of a 26 inch waist or 32 inch ways, this is the size of your stomach, okay? So it's just above your hips, right? As you say it's your stomach and well we measure the wa and now in men, especially they measure the in insane. Now this is very particular for tailors and having suits me, what is it it seem?Well, think of the word in inside. This is the.The inside of your pants. So from your foot to the middle of your pants where your zippers start. Okay, so that's not the outside length, it's the inside length. Okay, now for example skirts they don't have instinct, right? No, because there's no inside. There's no milk, right? So it's just like a circle, okay, but in pants or shorts you have it in.See, that's where it's a connected in the middle. Alright, so also in short, very interesting so you can measure the of pants or shorts. Alright, so very interesting in particular words for tailors, why don't we listen to our dialogue again and move back shortly


Actually, now we have three key phrases that we found in this dialogue. So let's take a look at them now in fluency build.Fluency builder this first phrase is the topic of today's lesson. A, we talked a little bit about measurements for a suit.Suits, but in particular we're getting a custom made suit.So this word custom made well. Custom is important. It means special or unique. There's no other like it. So we could talk about custom cars. That means a car that has been fixed.OK, so a custom made.For your height. For how big thingsc specifically for you?Right, so a suit that I buy at the department store is just a normal suit, but a suit that I have made for me is a custom made.And as you said, you can use it for cars, car or maybe, for example, a custom.Custom made kitchen. That means that you get to pick every single part of the kitchen that you want. Many people do that right? They have custom built or custom made homes? Yeah, that's, that's always something I wanted to do but I hear that it's much more expensive than getting a normal homemade. Alright, so that's the first key phrase now moving on   08:00

So a little bit too short, but when you come to a place like China, and most people can get these.Made for them, they just look.Look fab looks very, very nice.Yeah, so

First key phrase now moving on, when we talk about measuring, we say I measured, I measured the length of the street.Right. Or let's measure you so we can see how big you are. But if you notice in the dial

A: That’s right! Now class, if something bad happened and you had to get help, do you know what  phone number you would call?

*  198  Applying  CPR

A:  Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course. First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?
B:Cardio pulmonary resuscitation!  [ˌkɑrdioʊˈpʊlməˌnɛri]   [rɪˌsʌsɪˈteɪʃ(ə)n]
A:That’s right! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.
B:What does that mean?
A:Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood, or your lungs stop pumping air, then we need to get them going again! That’s when we have to  apply this procedure. Let’s begin! I need a volunteer.
B:Me! Me!
A:Alright, come here and lay flat on your back. Let’s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.We must lift the person’s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over the other person’s mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.
B:Wait, what are you doing? I’m a married woman! You can’t just try to kiss me like this!
A:Ma’ am I’m not trying to kiss you! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.
B:Well, ok. But no French kissing!
A:As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner. Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.
To do this, we place our hands over the person’s chest, and press down firmly two or three times.
B:Wait, what are you doing! You can’t just kiss me  then go for second base!( touch the breast[brest] )

*  237 Morning Routine

Jacob: Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning?

Stephanie: It’s a skill. What can I say? I don’t know why, I just have a long routine.
Jacob: Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so complicated? You get up , you shower, you get dressed , you brush your teeth, you’re out the door. Half  an hour, tops.

Stephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and  head straight for the shower. Every  second day , I wash my hair. If it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need  to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily.
Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out  too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in  under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get  dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning.
In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blowdry it straight.
And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.
Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?
Stephanie:Not funny

B:Got it.
A:No we are gonna make the batter. Take some  butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency. Then add some vanilla extract  and eggs and continue mixing.
B:Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric  mixer?
A:Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium  speed. I’m gonna sift the flour and baking powder  separately and then we can mix it with milk and  the rest of the ingredients.
B:Ok, so now we need a baking pan right?
A:Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won’t  stick to it when it bakes.
B:Done. So how long do we bake it for?
A:We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes. Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.
B:Wow! This was a lot easier than I thought!
